<p class="drop-cap">
Every year more and more is the constantly
recurring question ever put
"Where shall we go to this Summer?"
and every year the field for selection gets narrower
and narrower.
</p>

<p>
In writing the following pages, my object has
been less to make a book than to point out to those
who are tired of the old beaten tracks, countries
within easy reach of London, but seldom visited,
and quite outside the lines affected by the typical
tourist:—countries where at moderate expense and
with total freedom from danger they may enjoy new
scenery, receive fresh impressions, acquire new
information; and if by so doing I shall have
suggested to others one more field for exploration
that shall afford them half the enjoyment which I
experienced during my wanderings, I shall consider
myself very amply rewarded.

"LET us go to Lapland!" was the
exclamation which rang on my ear,
as I was entering my club, one
fine morning in the early part of June, 1873.
</p>

<p>
"Lapland!" said I, "what put that into your
head?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied my friend M—, in his rich, good-humoured
voice, slightly flavoured with Hibernian
Doric. "I hear that somebody has written a
book about it. I have been everywhere else
in Europe—and it is quite the place to go to
now, you know. We shall pic-nic on Cape North
and then drive across to Spitzbergen in reindeer
sledges on the ice, it will be awfully jolly!"
and his joyous laugh echoed through the hall.
"Do come, like a good fellow," said he, "there
will be just the four of us, R—, C—, yourself,
and I, and you really must not say no, for
we none of us can speak a word of anything
but English, while you speak every language
under the sun. So agree to it at once; let us
all meet here to dinner, to-morrow at six, and then
off by the mail to Calais."
</p>

<p>
At first I thought that M— was chaffing;
but having now been joined by R— and
C—, who at once chimed in on the same
subject, I said,
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea about Lapland, my
dear M—, do you know anything about it?
and what do you expect to see there?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear me, yes," replied he, "it is a
country in the North of Europe, surrounded on
all sides either by land or by water, and inhabited
by men who are four feet six high, and the
darlingest little women just four feet nothing.
They go to church on Sundays, riding on reindeer,
and shoot Polar bears with bows and
arrows! Oh dear, yes, I know all about Lapland."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all a bad account," said I, "but
what writes Captain Hutchinson in his book?
Is his description of Lapland very captivating?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered M—, "I confess I have
not read his book; but go abroad I must,
London is getting too stupid, and I have been
everywhere else in Europe; and I want to see
a country out of the beaten track, something I
have not yet seen."
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear fellow," said I, "though I
have not been exactly in Lapland, I have been
in Finland, and that, you know, is just next
door to it; and knowing what the mosquitoes
are in those swampy northern latitudes, nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
could induce me to visit those countries again
in Summer, except for very cogent reasons
indeed. But come now, tell me where have
you been, that you say you have seen every
other country in Europe?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," answered M—. "I have been twice
to Italy, up and down, and done it as thoroughly
as any man could do it. I have been—"
</p>

<p>
"Stop a wee," said I, "how have you <i>done</i>
Italy? let me see, suppose we just begin in the
middle, let us take Florence—no doubt you
were there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, yes, and such a jolly place, where
one could live and love for ever! oh, yes,

"If it were not for the heat, and having been
there twice already, it would beat going to see
the sun at midnight, which we shall see in
Lapland, old fellow. We shall see the sun
going right round the horizon, neither rising
nor setting—not a bit—but going just as
in the old riddle we had when we were
children, 'going round and round the house, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
never touching the house.' So now no more
'shirking and lurking,' but let's be off to
Lapland, and if there are a few mosquitoes, we
can take plenty of flea-powder to protect us;
there now, I'll stand the flea-powder—a whole
pound's worth," and the laugh of that excellent
fellow rings in my ears still.
</p>

<p>
Here R— joined in the conversation; he had
never been to Italy, and his curiosity was raised
by the enthusiastic expressions of my friend
M—, in regard to Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Do tell us something about that place,
where you could live and love for ever," said
he.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what <i>can</i> I tell you?" replied M—.
"Florence was the capital of Tuscany, and is
situated on the banks of the river Arno, and it
is a most delightful place. What more do you
want? There is the charming Mrs. —, and
her equally charming daughter, whose house opens
just as the opera closes; and once there, one
never thinks of leaving till three o'clock in
the morning at soonest. Then there are the
Cascine, the Café Doney, and the club, and my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
friend G. M—y; and then the churches and
the galleries, and the <span lang="it_IT">pietre dure</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c., I
did every one of them."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you go when you left Florence?"
</p>

<p>
"To Rome, naturally."
</p>

<p>
"So all you know about Tuscany and Central
Italy resolves itself into the Cascine, the Café
Doney, and our friend G. M—y. Did you
not even visit Siena on your way to Rome?"
</p>

<p>
"No, for, being fond of the sea, I went to
Rome by Civita Vecchia."
</p>

<p>
"When you were at Civita Vecchia, did it not
come into your head to visit the birth-place of
the Tarquins—Corneto? only a short drive from
Civita Vecchia, and one of the most interesting
places in Italy."
</p>

<p>
"I never even heard of it," said M—.
</p>

<p>
I was going to say <i><span lang="la">ex uno disce omnes</span></i>, this is
how <i><span lang="fr_FR">la jeunesse doré</span></i> of the present time travel on
the continent—to finish their education, by the way!
but my remark would be of too sweeping a
character, for there are many exceptions to be met
with occasionally. Still, though travelling is multiplied
a thousand-fold compared with what it used to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
be even only a century ago, it is doubtful, I think,
if travelling is as fruitful of good results in our
days as it used to be in the days of our grandfathers,
when, under the guidance of a well qualified
tutor, young men used to take the "grand
tour" with a view to completing their education,
the foundation and groundwork of which had been
laid first in our public schools, and then in
our great universities. Now my friend M—
was a charming fellow, well educated to a certain
point, pleasant, agreeable, and good-tempered; he
had travelled a good deal, and yet I may safely
say he had seen nothing, and simply because he
had not prepared himself for travelling with a
view to thoroughly seeing the countries he intended
visiting, and obtaining the information they could
bestow. And how many are there that just travel
in the same way! How many are there among
those who yearly flood the approaches to the
Eternal City who do more than lounge about the
galleries, the Campo Vaccino, or the Pincian Hill!
and who, if asked about the City of Veii (for
instance) will simply open their eyes and say they
never heard of it, where is it? Why, my good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
fellow, Veii was a great city, and its inhabitants
among the most civilized and luxurious in the
world, long before Rome was built. What! before
Rome was built? he will say; and then if some
mild reminiscence of the kind comes across his
memory, he may, perhaps, recall some fleeting
visions of Agamemnon and Mycenæ, taking it
for granted that Veii, if anterior to Rome, must
have been in Greece; but when informed that
Veii was the rival of Rome, that its ruins were
within twenty miles of the Eternal City, he will
possibly get angry and think you are chaffing him.
He, no doubt, may have heard of Etruria, but
probably in his mind it was jumbled up with
Minton's pottery; if associated with Wedgewood,
it will be a point in his favour. He may probably
have heard of Etruscan cities and Etruscan vases,
but all his information in this line is terribly hazy;
and so he dawdles through his sojourn at Rome,
goes on to Naples, perhaps to Palermo and Malta,
returning to England by the P. and O. steamer,
imagining that he has seen, or <i>done</i>, Italy, as he
terms it.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that I had made arrangements
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
for another tour, and was thus unable to join my
three friends in their intended expedition; but the
following Winter M— and I went to the
continent together, we spent four months in Italy,
that Italy he had so thoroughly "done" twice
before! and to his amazement, he had to confess
that in his previous journeys he had simply wasted
his time and his money.
</p>

<p>
We visited numberless out of the way places,
having made Florence our head-quarters for
Central Italy, and there under the guidance of
Micali's <i><span lang="it_IT">Antichi Popoli Italiani</span></i>, we dived into the
history of Italy, beginning with the misty periods
synchronous with the siege of Troy, illustrating
them as we went along by visits to the ancient
cities and cemeteries of Etruria, and thence through
those glorious Middle Ages and their unparalleled
works of art, which can nowhere be so well studied
as in Italy! It was a surpassing pleasure to him,
no doubt, to see for the first time all those wondrous
things; but it was almost as great a delight
to me to witness his raptures, his astonishment,
as city after city came under our examination—Fiesole,
Volterra, Chiusi, Cortona. This last,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
especially, struck him with astonishment, a city
co-eval with Ilium, and still in our days a city
preserving its ancient name, while of Ilium, <i><span lang="la">periêre
ipsæ ruinæ</span></i>, and its very existence questioned, till the
researches of the indefatigable Schliemann brought
monuments to light within the last few months
which have clearly identified the spot, and proved
to a demonstration that Ilium really had existed,
and that the siege of Troy was not simply a
myth, a poet's dream!
</p>

<p>
I well remember helping him to measure the
immense blocks of the ancient walls of Cortona,
fitted with such wonderful exactness that the
blade of a penknife can even at present be scarcely
pushed in between them, and which still remain
<i><span lang="la">in situ</span></i> without mortar or other cement, though
probably thirty centuries have rolled on since those
walls were erected by the ancestors of their present
inhabitants. How I remember the interest he
took in scanning from the hill which looks over the
rippling water of the Trasymene Lake, pointing
out the probable spot where those false-hearted
Romans had rested whilst the battle was raging
below, only to be overtaken, however, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
morrow by Hannibal and his victorious legions,
who made them pay so dearly for their
treachery.
</p>

<p>
"This is the way I like to study history, and
this is the way never to forget it," said he. "I
hated the very names of Tacitus and Livy, but
how delightful I think them now!" and so we
did <i>do</i> Italy from Agrigentum to the Alps, and
from the Adriatic to the Mediterranean, and many
queer out-of-the-way places we visited, and such
scores of sketches we carried away; and a
more delightful trip never was made before or
since.
</p>

<p>
Captain Hutchinson, in his introduction to
"Try Lapland," writes, "The difficulty of finding
new ground for travel is increasing every year
for those who, with but a limited time at their
disposal, are yet tired of the beaten paths of
Ramsgate or Scarborough, Switzerland or the Rhine,
and pant after lands fresh and fair, of which they
have never seen the photograph—where the
gorgeous hotel with its elongated bills, and the
pertinacious touter with his cringing greasy manners,
are alike unknown."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Now to a great extent that pleasant writer
is correct; but the man who rushing away from
the turmoil and bustle of London life, whether he
be lawyer, merchant, or physician, seeking for
fresh air and scenery, but as far away as possible
from those hackneyed tracks infested by the
typical tourist, both English and Transatlantic,
and by poor Marryat's "shilling-seeking, napkin-holding,
up-and-downstairs son of a sea-cook"
of an hotel waiter, need not go to the Arctic
Circle to find all the above-named advantages, unless,
indeed, he is bent on also seeing the sun at
midnight, and his own body a prey to the
mosquitoes.

<p>
Within five days of Temple Bar, or as we
soon shall have to say, where Temple Bar once
stood, there are as splendid countries to explore, as
fine ruins to contemplate, as glorious scenery and
as gorgeous costumes to admire, as the heart of man
can wish for; and if the reader will trust himself
with me for a little while, excusing the many shortcomings
he will meet with in these pages, I will
lead him over a trip I took last Summer which I
think will fully repay him, though he will often
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
have to make great allowances and deal leniently
with the Author, who for the first time in his
life rushes into print, just for the same reason
that the stars shine above us, because he has
nothing else to do! But if through publishing
this little book he shall have opened up a new
field of travel to those who yearly require to
recruit their strength of body and of mind by
a ramble in foreign lands, if he shall have added
one more possible source of enjoyment to those
within the reach of the many, he will consider
himself amply repaid for whatever trouble he may
have been put to in its compilation.

<p class="drop-cap">
I STARTED from London for my
holiday trip early in the month of
June, 1873. The route I had laid
out for myself on my departure was
not exactly that which I eventually adopted,
for nothing is truer than that man proposes,
but God disposes. I had intended visiting the
Crimea, and then crossing over the Straits of
Kertch, I meant to have rambled over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
the Caucasus, finishing my trip with a visit to
the Monastery of Echmiadzin, at the foot of Mount
Ararat.
</p>

<p>
But it was not to be; I got as far as Pesth,
when the cholera, which was then very active,
not to say raging in Hungary, barred my further
passage down the river into the Lower Provinces
of the Danube, by threatening me with a
quarantine of eleven days in a dirty lazzaretto,
at a temperature of at least 90° in the shade. I
would have risked the cholera, but I could not
face the loss of eleven days in the limited time
I had at my disposal, nor could I contemplate
at all the horrors of an Oriental lazzaretto.
All my plans were therefore upset; still
the result was eventually satisfactory, as I
think I shall be able to prove in the following
pages.
</p>

<p>
After leaving London, I made straight for
Vienna, by Brussels and Cologne, where I remained
only a few hours, during which I visited
for the twentieth time and more that exquisite
specimen of ecclesiastical structure, its unrivalled
Cathedral; every time I see it I admire it more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
and more, I think there are none to equal it,
while most certainly none surpass it.
</p>

<p>
St. Peter's at Rome is a magnificent building,
astonishes one by its size and its rich adornments,
but it fails to impress one from a religious point of
view. It might be a church, or it might be a grand
reception room, a <i><span lang="fr_FR">salle des ambassadeurs</span></i>, or a colossal
ball-room—whereas the Cathedral of Cologne is a
church, a place of worship, and nothing else. I suppose
there is something in the pure Gothic architecture
conducive to this impression. There is
but one other church I know of in the world
which has the same solemn awe-producing effect,
perhaps in a greater degree even than the Cathedral
of Cologne, and that is Santa Maria del Fiore,
the Cathedral of Florence. I have been hundreds
of times in that grand old edifice, but
never without feeling an overwhelming sense of
solemnity and awe. It was not only the low
murmuring notes of the organ sounding the
responses at eve to the plaintive litanies of the
Virgin, nor the deep tones of the full accompaniment
to the <i><span lang="la">Miserere mei Deus</span></i> in the
Passion Week, which produced it, for I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
perhaps oftener there when all was silent, than
during festive times, as I have always had the
greatest objection to going into Catholic churches
during service, gaping about and sight-seeing, to
the evident annoyance and discomfort of the
worshippers—a habit which, I regret to say,
many of our country people too often indulge
in, greatly to our detriment, especially in the
less frequented places of the continent, where
the people have come to regard us as heathens,
and constantly to say of us, "<span lang="it_IT">Non sanno meglio,
non sono Cristiani</span>."
</p>

<p>
It was something more than all this which
ever filled me with a feeling of intense devotion
when I entered that grand old building.
The severe simplicity of the structure, with no
tawdry ornamentation to obtrude itself and take
off the attention, may have played an important
part in giving birth to solemn thoughts, together
with the height and size of the three enormous
pilasters which alone support the roof—the lofty
arches, the vast depth and gloom of the aisles,
the intensity of the shade, the deep silence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
made still more impressive by an occasional foot-fall—all
would combine to proclaim this a house
of prayer, and nothing else; a Temple in the
fullest and most unequivocal sense of the word,
offering to the old and the broken-spirited, to
the infirm and to all who sought it in prayer, an
assurance of tranquillity, consolation, and peace!
</p>

<p>
Having enjoyed my oft-repeated visit, and purchased
a large supply of Eau de Cologne from
the Farina <i><span lang="de_DE">gegenüber dem Julichs Platz</span></i>, (and don't
you believe that the others make it near as good),
I got in the train for Munich and for Vienna.
</p>

<p>
I think I see a smile, slightly perhaps savouring
of a sneer, from some of my readers of the
masculine gender, at my purchase of a large
supply of Eau de Cologne; but just let them
hold hard, till they shall have endured the trials
of hot winds and dusty roads in the daytime,
stuffy cabins and the ordinary accompaniment of
flea invasions and other entomological attacks in
the night-time; and then if they have the luck
to have any of it with them, they will discover
the use of Eau de Cologne in allaying pain and
irritation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Travellers in all Eastern countries should have
with them a supply of good Eau de Cologne,
not for scenting their pocket-handkerchiefs only,
but principally as a remedy. Some people suffer
more, some suffer less from insect attacks; but
I have seen a man, a strong, stout, brawny
Britisher, set nearly wild by flea-bites, and I
shall never forget his appearance, as he stood
before me one morning, after passing a restless night
in a very wild region in the South of Europe, like
a patient with small-pox, and scratching away at
himself for bare life. I am sure he would have
been in a high fever that night, had I not
bathed him with a mixture of equal parts of
Eau de Cologne, laurel water, and sal-volatile.
So don't forget it, kind reader, if ever in your
travels you are likely to be in countries infested
with insect tribes; whatever their nature may be,
whether the mosquito which flieth, the flea which
hoppeth, or t'other thing which crawleth, my nostrum
will be found a sovereign remedy against them all.
</p>

<p>
Although the Vienna Exhibition was fully
open, and that numbers were flocking from all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
parts to that most charming capital, which has
so justly acquired the epithet of "<span lang="fr_FR">le Paradis
des Hommes</span>," I was fortunate in having but
one companion in the train all the way, and
thus we both were enabled to extend our limbs
and sleep as comfortably as in our beds. It is
wonderful the amount of comfort one can
obtain through life by the judicious distribution
of a few cigars accompanied by a little
silver!
</p>

<p>
At Vienna, I went—as I always do—to the
Archduke Charles' Hotel; a little old-fashioned,
perhaps, but unquestionably the best hotel in
Vienna, and where the cooking is always undeniable.
During my short stay, I went every
day to the Universal Exhibition—the world's
fair! but don't be afraid that I mean to weary you by
dragging you with me through those confusing
avenues of "all sorts," where nothing that was
wanted could be found, and everything we wanted
not was sure to be everlastingly obtruding itself
before our eyes.
</p>

<p>
I confess that the Vienna Exhibition disappointed
me; whereas the Paris one of 1867 left me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
nothing to desire; and all owing to the want
of order and system in the one instance—while
in the other, the arrangement was so perfect
that there was not the smallest difficulty in
getting at anything one wanted to find
out.
</p>

<p>
But if the exhibitional department was less
perfect in its arrangement at Vienna than at
Paris, the gardens and the outside accessories
were far more beautiful at the former than the
latter; while Strauss's delightful band always
afforded an hour's luxurious enjoyment in the cool
of the afternoon, till the fearful braying of the steam
trumpet, (they called it a Telephone, I think) drove
one out into the Prater. Then the restaurants
and cafés of the different Nationalities were so
well got up and so picturesquely scattered about
the Gardens, as were also the several buildings
characteristic of the different Nations, and among
which was pre-eminent for elegance of form,
design, and execution, the kiosk of the Pasha of
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
And then the Viennese ladies! I know I
should have mentioned them the first, I confess
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
it; <i><span lang="la">confiteor, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</span></i>, but,
gentle reader, it was from sheer diffidence! I did
not know how to approach the subject, I felt
myself totally incompetent, and indeed I do so
now! To say that at Vienna there are more
lovely women to be seen than in any other
city in Europe, is not saying one half. There
are loads of pretty women to be seen in Dublin
of a fine Sunday afternoon, especially among the
middle and lower classes; but at Vienna they
are not only lovely, but terribly attractive, and
winning, and seductive; there are none like them
anywhere else!
</p>

<p>
In the fine arts department there were many
beautiful things to be seen; but as I promised not
to drag the reader round the World's Fair, I shall
keep my word, and shall only call his attention
to two statues which greatly attracted me, one
was a bronze figure of a Hindoo charming a
cobra, the other a Negro running away, both
figures perfectly alive!
</p>

<p>
I went twice to the opera, once to hear
Meyerbeer's "Africaine," which disappointed me;
and once to see a grand ballet, I think it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
called "Eleonora," which did not. I had not
been for several years at Vienna, and had, therefore,
not seen the new Opera House. I was
greatly struck with its size and beauty; it is
unquestionably the finest theatre in Europe, and
the arrangements are perfect. But Vienna is
now undergoing such a process of transformation,
and to such an extent, that in a few years
those who knew it ten or twelve years ago will
be utterly unable to recognise it. Even now it is
one of the finest capitals in Europe, but at the
rate it is progressing, it bids fair to surpass in
a short time every other city, when the Viennese
will really be able to give utterance with truth to
their old saying, "<span lang="de_DE">Gibt nur eine Kaiserstadt, gibt
nur ein Wien</span>!"
</p>

<p>
After a very delightful week in Vienna, which
seemed indeed far too short a time to bestow
upon the most enjoyable capital in Europe, I
took my passage in a steamer to Pesth, starting
at six <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and arriving at my destination at about
the same hour in the evening. The steamer was
a very fine one, the accommodation excellent,
the cuisine not good, but then I had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
terribly spoilt at the Erz-Herzog Karl; probably
had I been at a worse hotel, I would not have
found so much fault with the cookery on board
the steamer. The company on board was
worse than the cookery—in all my rambles
I don't think I ever met so unprepossessing
a lot.
</p>

<p>
The large steamers that navigate the Danube
don't come up to Vienna, but lie off the Island
of Lobau, to which passengers are carried in a
smaller steamer. The morning I started was
drizzling and chilly in the extreme, in marked
contrast with the weather of the previous week,
which had been intensely hot; and when I sat
down on the deck of the little steamer which was
to take me down a branch of the Danube to the
main steamer, I was glad to avail myself of my
top-coat and rugs. In a short time we reached
the larger vessel, and, having all got on board, we
started at a good round speed.
</p>

<p>
From Vienna to Gran, the Danube is uninteresting
so far as scenery is concerned. Its enormous

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
hundred miles from its entrance into the Black
Sea, flows through a vast flat country; an interminable
front of sallows and alders on the one
side, and an interminable plain on the other,
dotted all over with countless herds of white
cattle with long black horns like the Tuscan
oxen, and endless troops of horses; and as I
gazed on the mighty flood of turbid waters,
the old Italian nursery rhyme came back to my
memory.

We passed by Pressburg where the two sides
of the river are united by a bridge of boats. We
only remained a short time and I had no opportunity
of going ashore, so that I could form but
a very inaccurate opinion of the place; it seemed
to me from its outward look as not now prosperous,
but had quite the appearance of having seen
better days.
</p>

<p>
After a time we came to Komorn, the celebrated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
fortress; if I had not been told, "There is
Komorn," I might almost have passed it without
observing it, so protected from sight are its bastions
by the immense earthworks in front of them. Still
down we steamed, and still the same country
right and left met our view, till we came to Gran,
the seat of the Prince-Primate of Hungary,
perhaps one of the wealthiest prelates in the world,
possessing no less an income than £90,000
per annum.
</p>

<p>
Here the scenery began to improve; the Cathedral
of Gran, though in itself unclassical, and one that
in any other place might be passed by unnoticed,
yet served to relieve the monotony of the view.
The river, which up to this had flowed through
boundless plains, became suddenly contracted, and
consequently swifter as the high lands approached
the edge of it; and now with every revolution
of the paddles the scenery improved, till
on reaching Vissegrad it became absolutely
lovely. Instead of the interminable plains, we now
had precipitous mountains on either side, some
clad with forest down to the water's edge, some
bare, ragged, and rocky, but all lovely, quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
equal to the finest parts of the Rhine, not
even lacking a Drachenfels in the beautiful ruins
of the ancient castellated palace of the Kings of
Hungary, the favourite retreat of the learned
Matthias Corvinus.
</p>

<p>
Nature has done everything to beautify this
favoured spot, but man, as is too often the case,
has done his best to mar it. At the foot of the
cliff, the top of which is crowned by the ancient
residence of the Kings of Hungary, on a beautifully
wooded spot between the mountain and the rushing
Danube, some enterprising German has erected,
<i><span lang="la">horribile visu</span></i>, three villa residences, in the correct
suburban style, a few yards distant from one
another. Regardless of expense, everything about
them, including themselves, is radiant with white-wash,
except where green paint asserts its place.
At first I thought it must be an hotel or pension,
with two <i>succursales</i>; but no, the skipper assured
me they were country houses, and seemed astonished
when I said the man that built them deserved
to be hanged in front of them; he could not
comprehend me, he thought them lovely!
</p>

<p>
Often during my subsequent travels I thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
of that lovely country between Gran and Vissegrad;
such exquisite scenery, so diversified; such a
combination of rolling pastures, of glorious hills
clad with forests, backed by rugged mountains,
with that grand old Danube rushing through the
midst; such shooting and fishing, all in a
compact locality, and only four hours by rail from
Vienna; such a spot for a country residence
could scarcely be equalled, and certainly not
surpassed. If it were within ten hours of
London, what a fabulous price it would command!
but here no one seems to have
placed any value on it since the days of Matthias
Corvinus.
</p>

<p>
After going through this gorge, the Danube
spreads itself out again, and the scenery becomes
tame and uninteresting, and continues so till one
reaches Pesth, where I arrived somewhat later
than I expected.

<p class="drop-cap">
I DROVE to the Hotel Ungaria, to
which I had been recommended, and
where a most comfortable apartment
and an equally good dinner gave me an <i><span lang="fr_FR">avant-goût</span></i>
of a comfortable night's rest, in which I was
no wise disappointed; and I can safely recommend
the Ungaria as one of the finest and most
comfortable hotels in Europe, without at the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
time being extravagant in its charges. The only
drawback I found was with the person of the porter,
a most respectable man no doubt, but he could
not speak either French or English; and I had
to carry on all my consultations respecting my
intended future progress with the hall-porter of
the "Königin von England" hotel, close by.
If that man could only be installed at the Ungaria,
that hotel would be as near perfection as
possible.
</p>

<p>
The windows of my bedroom at the Ungaria
opened out on a balcony which gave me a
splendid view of the "blue Danube," which, however,
I never saw of any other shade but mud
colour. Across the river, and just opposite, I
could see the ancient city of Buda, with the royal
residence in front, and a little to the left, on
the top of the hill, the celebrated fortress which
played so important a part during the last
Hungarian civil war. A little to my right was
the grand suspension bridge, guarded at each
end by two colossal couchant lions, about which
the following improbable anecdote was related to
me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The artist who executed them forgot to put
tongues into their mouths, to loll out in proper
heraldic fashion, and when the defect was pointed
out to him as the lions were uncovered, he took
it so to heart that he at once put an end to
himself by plunging headlong into the river!
Now when "le grand Vatel" committed suicide,
because the turbot did not arrive in time for
the dinner of the Most Christian King, there
was some show of reason in the act, Vatel's
credit was in some degree pledged to that dinner;
but not one man in ten thousand would
have noticed whether these lions had tongues
or not.
</p>

<p>
Pesth seems, like Vienna, to be undergoing a
process of rebuilding, and that on a scale of
considerable magnificence. I was told that its
commerce was daily increasing, and, certainly, to
judge from the immense number of vessels
moored in the river, the ceaseless passing up
and down of immense steamers, the piles of
merchandize, and the constant bustle on the
quays, a very considerable amount of business
must be done there. The grand suspension
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
bridge which spans the Danube being found
insufficient for the increasing traffic, a new one
is in process of construction, to be built of
iron on piers, and not a suspension bridge. It
is to cost an immense sum, and will require
to be well protected against the action of the
ice on the one hand, while on the other it
may become the source of considerable danger
to the low land in its neighbourhood by
arresting the free passage downwards of the
ice, if not well looked after. I went to see
the works at the central pier, and remained there
some time watching the men at the bottom of
the immense caisson out of which a donkey
engine was incessantly pumping water; outside it,
the river was running like a mill race at not
less than eight miles an hour, and I was
assured that the depth at that spot was fully forty
feet.
</p>

<p>
After visiting the works at the new bridge,
I went to St. Marguerite's Island, on which
is a park beautifully laid out, and which forms
one of the favourite promenades of the pleasure-loving
inhabitants of Pesth. As it can only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
be approached by boat, it is frequented only
by pedestrians; but in order to cater for all
tastes and gratify those who enjoy a jaunt,
there is a tramway running the whole length
of the island. There are also some capital
restaurants, and several bands play every evening
in fine weather.
</p>

<p>
There is another park on <i><span lang="it_IT">terra firma</span></i>, an
imitation of the Prater at Vienna, but it is
small and shabby. There were a good many
people strolling about it when I went, but
I did not see even one middling-good turn-out,
and though one constantly hears of the
beautiful horses and rare horsemanship of the
Hungarians, I was doomed to be disappointed in
both cases.
</p>

<p>
Crossing over the suspension bridge one gets
into the old town of Buda or Ofen, in which
are situated the Royal residence, the Government
offices, and some of the palaces of the native
magnates.
</p>

<p>
There is a fine street by which one can drive
to the upper part of the town, which is considerably
above the level of the Danube; but for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
pedestrians there is an easy, cheap, and quick
method of getting to the summit, by means of a
small counterpoised railway, which carries one up
and down very rapidly at an exceedingly moderate
rate. There is a fine view from the top, and
several fine old palaces, but the most interesting
thing in the town of Buda is the old Roman
bath erected over some sulphurous springs, celebrated
for the cures they perform. It is in exactly
the same condition as in the days of ancient Rome,
and consists of a large vaulted apartment lit by a
circular opening in the centre of the cupola, and
containing a large hexagonal piscina with an
ambulatory all round. None bathe there save the
lower classes—men, women, and children promiscuously;
in the immediate neighbourhood,
however, there are some very well appointed
baths which are considerably patronized, and
bear a high reputation for the cure of skin
disease.
</p>

<p>
From all I could collect during the brief stay
I made at Pesth, Hungary in general must be
in a very progressive condition; and from the
numbers of agricultural machines and implements,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
all of English construction, which I saw everywhere
stacked upon the quays, not only at Pesth
but at many other stations on the Danube,
including large numbers of steam-thrashing and
winnowing machines, a vigorous attempt is evidently
being made to exploit the unbounded fertility of
perhaps the richest soil in Europe. Land, however,
is still cheap in Hungary, probably in consequence
of the extreme love of pleasure of its
inhabitants, who preferring to spend their days
in the society of Vienna, Paris, or Pesth, draw
exorbitantly on their revenues, till at last compelled
to sell their lands in order to meet their engagements.
Nice estates within twenty miles of Pesth,
with good substantial dwelling-houses, and all the
necessary offices for farming, with varied soil,
vineyard, pasture, tillage, and forest, can be had
sufficiently cheap to ensure a clear return of five
per cent, free of taxes, for the capital laid out
on them! A vast number of the agricultural
community in Hungary are Jews, and it is perhaps
the only country in Europe where we find the
children of Israel as tillers of the soil; and I was
assured by many in Pesth that they make by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
far the most satisfactory tenants—though naturally
they require looking after occasionally, as well as
their <i>soi-disant</i> Christian brethren.
</p>

<p>
When one reflects on the countless acres of the
richest land in creation, which to a great extent
are still unoccupied and uncultivated in the eastern
and south-eastern regions of Europe, one cannot
help regretting that some of our surplus population
do not try a venture in those countries. I
am thinking principally of that most unfortunate
and ill-used portion of society belonging to the
upper classes, and which, from circumstances beyond
its control, is suffering from positive want in its
struggles to keep up a respectability as necessary
for its existence as the very air it breathes. The
labourer, the artisan, the skilled workman are well
off at the present time in our country; wages are
very high and the friendly societies, to one of
which almost every workman belongs, provide for
them amply in cases of sickness, and in some
cases even contribute something to the family
when the illness terminates in death—not to
mention the numerous hospitals and asylums, all
open to the labouring classes, but which are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
all virtually closed to those I am now speaking
of.
</p>

<p>
The working classes, with few exceptions, are
all well off at present, and require none of our
sympathy except when in affliction, when the richest
and poorest come to the same level. They can
afford to supply all their wants out of their
wages, and lay out <i>one fifth</i>, and in many cases
<i>one fourth</i>, and even <i>one third</i> (I am assured by
good authorities) in drink, for the gratification
of the only pleasure which they are capable
of enjoying; for proof of which the police
reports throughout the country will bear ample
evidence.
</p>

<p>
But I will tell who really deserve all our
sympathy and all our aid, the junior branches of
our upper ten thousand—the families of officers,
poor clergymen, poor lawyers, &amp;c., &amp;c., all
struggling for dear life against difficulties of every
kind; those are the classes who claim the greatest
share of our sympathy, and to whom the regions
above mentioned offer advantages unequalled any
where else.
</p>

<p>
I remember when the Canterbury settlement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
was established in New Zealand, it was intended
in a great measure to provide for the classes I
have alluded to above; but the distance was too
great, the mere cost of going out was a most
serious drawback, at the very least <i>ten times</i> the
amount required to land one bag and baggage in the
centre of Hungary, or better still in Servia, among
some of the most beautiful scenery in the world,
the richest soil, the best climate, and the finest
fishing and shooting that could be desired, where
game laws and river preserves and licences are
still utterly unknown.
</p>

<p>
I hate croaking; still, if one hears rumbling
noises underground for any space of time, one
is justified in apprehending an earthquake. For
several years I have been hearing these subterranean
noises, and year after year they have
become more and more threatening, and the
earthquake must come at last. But as a volcanic
eruption, acting as a safety valve, often saves a
country from the effects of a physical earthquake,
so the timely exodus of an excessive
population may save a country from a moral
one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
</p>

<p>
By the very nature of my profession, I have
innumerable times been willingly or unwillingly
let into the secrets of the private affairs of
scores of families; and I have watched with
perfect dismay the misery, the poverty, the utter
wretchedness that were screened from the eyes of
the world by the decent exterior which was kept
up in order to preserve appearances.
</p>

<p>
If with Asmodeus we could but lift up the
roofs of a few thousands of houses in these
prosperous islands and see the difficulties, the
make-shifts, and the make-believes which are
resorted to, and that in many cases where one would
least expect them, it would make our very hearts
bleed at all the anxiety, all the wretchedness, all
the scalding tears which would be disclosed—all
brought about by that great delusion "keeping
up appearances." Well, all this living under false
pretences, which is the distinguishing characteristic
and the great evil, the real "social evil" of the
present time cannot go on for ever. It is an
evil of long standing, no doubt, but it has gone
on increasing from year to year, like a falling
avalanche, with constantly increasing velocity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
The earthquake must come at last, if not averted
by an emigration <i><span lang="fr_FR">en masse</span></i> of those educated
classes to which I have alluded above; and
the best, finest, healthiest, most fertile, and most
accessible country, outside the British dominions,
I hold to be, roughly speaking, that tract of
Southern Europe bounded on the North by the
Saave, on the South by the Bosphorus, on the
East by the Danube, and on the West by the
Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Sir," I think I hear some
reader say, "that is Turkey in Europe!" No
doubt it is, but the Turks won't be there for
ever, their time is nearly run out; the period of
their wretched misrule over the Christian populations
of Europe is nearly accomplished, and I
still hope to live long enough to see those
barbarous hordes recrossing the Bosphorus into
Asia Minor, on their way back to the Steppes of
Khiva and Bokhara, from whence they originally
emigrated. They have ever shown themselves
irreclaimable barbarians throughout. Look at the
present condition of European Turkey, after centuries
of Ottoman dominion; contrast it with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
nascent state of Roumania, which only quite lately
succeeded in shaking off its Moslem chains. Let
us look at both countries, as they present themselves
opposite to each other on the banks of
the Danube. On the left bank of that river we
have Giurgevo in Roumania, the port of Bukharest,
where, notwithstanding centuries of slavery and
misgovernment, the natives, now under the government
of an enlightened Christian Prince, are all
activity and progress—while on the right bank at
Rustchuk, just opposite, in dark contrast to the
Christian, who is trying to turn to account all
the advantages of his country, the indolent, uncivilized
Turk is still lazily dozing away,
leaning against his ancient painted and bedizened
araba, drawn by a pair of patient oxen,
waiting for the chance of some solitary, silent
traveller!
</p>

<p>
A new era is dawning, however, over these
south-eastern regions, but much of their prosperity
and future happiness may depend on the model
they will propose for themselves in their efforts
at civilization; whether the brilliant glitter of
Parisian veneering and varnish, or the less attractive,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
but more solid advantages of British institutions.
A great future is before the Danubian
Principalities, may they use their opportunities with
wisdom, and may they prosper!

THAT odious and useless mediæval
institution, the quarantine, having
barred my passage into the Lower
Provinces of the Danube, I determined
to go to Trieste, then proceed by sea
to Constantinople, and thence to the Caucasus,
but it was written differently in the book of
Fate!
</p>

<p>
The line to Trieste was full of interest; during
the first portion of the journey I passed quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
close to Lake Balaton, celebrated for its fish, and
then after traversing some wonderfully rich plains,
dotted here and there with patches of forest, and
covered with herds of cattle, horses, and geese,
which are kept here in vast numbers for the
sake of their feathers, arrived at Steinbrück at
one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, where I dined. Here, at the junction
of the Saane and the Saave, the scenery became
truly magnificent; we had been for some time
following the banks of the Saane, and the
mountains had been getting closer and higher
with every mile we made, till at last they
actually came down to the river, allowing a bare
passage to the railway which followed its every
bend.
</p>

<p>
Having finished our mid-day meal at Steinbrück—where
the Pesth line joins on to that
miracle of engineering, the celebrated railway
between Vienna and Trieste—we resumed our
journey, the scenery retaining its grand features,
till having topped the Sömmering, we came on
to the desert Karst and got our first peep of
the salt water—the glorious Adriatic. Nothing
could exceed the wild grandeur of the country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
on both sides of the railway, as the engines (for
we had two of them) slowly panted up those
steep inclines, winding in and out through the
gorges of the Sömmering, now plunging into a
tunnel to traverse the heart of a mountain, and
now crossing a viaduct between two cliffs, over a
precipice hundreds of feet in depth. Once at the
top, our pace increased considerably, and by eight
o'clock I found myself comfortably installed at
my hotel at Trieste, on the evening of the 29th
of June.
</p>

<p>
After a most refreshing night, I descended
the next morning to the café on the ground
floor of the hotel, and then heard for the first
time of the severe shocks of earthquake at
Belluno and its neighbourhood, which had been
felt even in Trieste. Several lives had been
lost, and one church nearly shaken to the
ground.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast I went to pay my respects to
our excellent consul, Captain Burton, and then
hearing that the Austrian ironclad "Lissa" was
outside the harbour, I took a boat and went to
have a look at her. She is a fine vessel with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
long projecting prow, and looks well in the water.
Having sent up my card, I was received and shown
over the ship by Lieutenant Count Petruski, who
was most kind in pointing out every thing of
interest connected with it. I think he said she
mounted 12 rifled fifteen-ton guns of our
Woolwich Infant type, and was furnished with
a galvanic apparatus, by means of which the
captain could fire a whole broadside at a time.
Although she was only in after a cruise, and
consequently not in the best of trim for exhibition,
I was much gratified by all I saw. The men were
a very fine set of fellows, the state cabins and
officers' cabins particularly neat and nice, and
should these lines ever fall beneath the eye of
Count Petruski or any of his brother officers on
board the "Lissa" I beg them all to receive my
warm thanks for their kindness to me that day.
I spent a couple of very pleasant hours on
board, and as Count Petruski spoke excellent
English, it made our interview all the more
agreeable.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Trieste is anything but an interesting place;
though a couple of days may be spent pleasantly
enough visiting the neighbourhood, especially if one
has the advantage of the acquaintance and company
of our consul, Captain R. Burton; the Burton
of Harar, of Mecca, and of Medina; the
<i><span lang="la">facile princeps</span></i> of modern travellers and pleasant
companions.
</p>

<p>
Why is Captain Burton kept at Trieste? It is
not a difficult post, nor one requiring a man with
exceptional qualifications; and it does seem a
misapplication if not a waste of <i>force</i> to keep a
man like Burton at Trieste, when he could be of
so much greater use elsewhere. The thorough
and intimate knowledge that he possesses of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
Oriental character, his perfect mastery of Arabic,
together with the knowledge he has of Persian
and scores of other languages, not to mention the
experience he has acquired of Oriental affairs,
customs and idiosyncrasies, all go to point him
out emphatically as the right man in the wrong
place at Trieste. I spent some very pleasant hours
in his company during my short stay in that
city, and shall never forget the kindness I
experienced both from him and la bella
Contessa, his most charming and accomplished
lady.
</p>

<p>
Thus far, my observations have been of a
strictly selfish nature. I know Captain Burton's
capabilities, I feel that he is utterly thrown away
where he is, and I want a <i><span lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i> for my
money—consequently I want to see him in some
post where his talents and exceptional qualifications
may be of some profit to me. The reader will
perceive that I am strictly selfish and utilitarian,
and that in writing as above I have not been
led away by sentimentality in any shape. Had I
been in the opposite vein, I could have said,
I met at Trieste Captain R. T. Burton, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
undoubtedly is the greatest of <i>living</i> travellers, and
also second to none in that great phalanx of
explorers, who from time to time have devoted
their lives to carrying civilization to the most
remote corners of the earth. He opened up
Eastern Africa, and most probably discovered in
Lake Tanganyika the mysterious sources of the
Nile. He directly opened up the path and led
the way which was subsequently trodden by Speke,
Grant, Stanley, Cameron, and others; indirectly
he pointed out the way to Baker, Schweinfurth and
Gordon. To Richard Burton then is due the
discovery of this <i>New Africa</i>, this great Lake
Region, so fertile and so rich in the centre of a
continent which fifty years ago was believed
to be one vast uninhabitable desert. What has been
his reward? He has been made consul at Trieste.
Here is an inducement to our ardent British
youth! I hear there is some talk of making him
a K.C.B.; for myself, I wouldn't give a roll of
ginger-bread for the distinction; however, let him
have it by all means, but let us see him also
removed to some more useful sphere of action
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
where his exceptional talents and his great
knowledge of Oriental languages may be of
service to us. Let him be sent to Africa
again—to Morocco for instance—at the first
vacancy.
</p>

<p>
Having still to wait a couple of days for the
departure of the steamer which was to take me
on my trip down the coast of Dalmatia, I employed
my time in paving a flying visit to San Canziano,
where a good-sized river, after meandering down
a deep ravine like any other Christian stream,
suddenly plunges into the bowels of the earth,
and after a mysterious course of many miles, reappears
again at the surface under a different
name, previous to losing itself in the
Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
The little hamlet of San Canziano is about
twenty miles from Trieste, it consists of a very small
and meanly built church, with a good campanile
however, with two sweetly-toned bells—why is
it that ours are always so unmusical and woody?—a
small wretched Presbytery, a roadside pot-house
where nothing could be got for love or money,
and half a dozen dilapidated houses. The drive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
however, was very pleasant, for the weather was
warm and at the same time cloudy, so that we
were never inconvenienced by the sun. The road,
on leaving Trieste, goes by easy windings over a
mountain clothed with oak, so beautifully kept,
that it gives the idea of driving through some
private park. On reaching the top we came into
the open, and had a glorious view of the Styrian
mountains on the one side, and the Adriatic on the
other. After driving for a short time on the
level, we again commenced ascending and soon got
into the "Karst," as it is called; a wild barren
tract where little or nothing appears to grow,
and where rocks and stones seem to have rained
down from heaven, not unlike some other spots I
visited subsequently in Dalmatia, and notably in
Montenegro. But this bleak and barren spot
owes its absolute desolation, not so much to the
rocky nature of its soil, as to the Bora, a north-east
wind, which often sweeps across it with the force
of a West Indian hurricane.
</p>

<p>
In many places on the road, traverses of immensely
thick stone walls had been erected for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
protection against the fury of the wind, but
notwithstanding all, the Karst is sometimes impassable
when the Bora blows in real earnest,
and heavy-laden waggons which have tried to
cross it at such times, have been turned over
and over like "leaves in Autumn weather."
After travelling for some short time along this
elevated plateau, we again began to descend, and
soon reached our destination, where, having eaten
the lunch I had brought with me, I started on
foot, under the guidance of a native who could
speak nothing but Styrian, to seek the mysterious
river.
</p>

<p>
In less than half an hour's walk, I found
myself on a grass-covered plateau of some miles
in extent, fringed in the distance by lofty hills,
dotted with clumps of fir trees, and after a few
minutes more walking in an easterly direction,
I suddenly came on a perpendicular precipice,
upwards of five hundred feet in depth, which
completely barred my further progress. The cliff
on which I stood rose in a narrow valley, or
glen, or cleft, as if the crust of the earth had
cracked here for a few miles. This cleft, nearly of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
uniform depth, was not of uniform width; in
some places it was so narrow that the smooth river
which glided through it completely filled it from
side to side, while in other places a sufficient strip
of soil remained between the river and the cliff to
admit of some amount of cultivation, and here
and there a cottage.
</p>

<p>
This strange cleft, or valley, or crack in the
plateau through which the river flows is of a most
irregular outline, going zig-zag, in and out, just
like the cracks one sees in a dried up pond at the
end of a hot Summer in England. I was standing
where this precipitous crack barred the way, by
running exactly at right angles across the path, and
here right under me at a depth of about five hundred
feet, the river which could be seen coursing from a
considerable distance at the bottom of the cleft,
suddenly leapt into a cavern and disappeared
beneath my feet.
</p>

<p>
Having made a rapid sketch of this extraordinary
landscape—or, more correctly speaking, having
tried to convey on paper some faint idea of what
the place was like—I again followed the guide, who
now, turning his back on the precipice, led me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
in a westerly direction, and brought me in a few
minutes to the brink of a fearful-looking circular
chasm, about fifty yards in diameter, with precipitous
rocky sides, and from the bottom of which
could be heard the distant roar of the river
rushing among the rocks. The guide threw some
large stones down this yawning gulph, disturbing
some thousands of rock-pigeons who build their
nests in the nooks and crannies of the rocks, and
having timed the fall of one of these stones by
listening for its splash in the subterranean river,
I noted about seven seconds as the time it took
in falling.
</p>

<p>
I now accompanied the guide through the little
hamlet of San Canziano, and still going westward
came just beyond the village on another chasm,
of oblong form, about six hundred yards one way,
and three hundred and fifty yards the other way,
while in depth it was no more than about fifty
yards. It looked to me as if this opening had been
made by the subsidence or falling-in of the roof
of some cavern, of which the limestone rock of
these mountains, as well in Styria as in Dalmatia
is so full. The sides of this depression were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
precipitous except in some places, and an easy
descent led me to the bottom, across which stretched
from side to side a fantastic ridge of rock pierced
by a natural arch about the middle, and under
which an opening in the rock gave entrance to
another cavern, through which anyone desirous of
exploring it could without much difficulty, but at the
cost of some fatigue and the risk of some falls,
descend by a series of about six hundred high and
slippery ledges of rock to where again the river
makes its appearance after its subterranean course.
</p>

<p>
As the day was pretty well advanced, and as
the weather, which had been cloudy all the morning
seemed now to be threatening rain, I thought it
wisest not to venture on going further, although the
guide had provided himself with candles for the
descent. So I scrambled up the sides of the
chasm, and was making for the roadside inn where
the carriage was waiting for me, when the storm-clouds,
which had been gathering thicker and thicker
for some time, broke out at last into such a deluge
of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning,
that I was glad to take refuge under the archway
of the belfry of San Canziano, and from thence into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
the church itself, the door of which was opened
for me by a queer little old dried-up chip of a
sexton.
</p>

<p>
I am sure he said to me, "Pray take shelter in
here from the rain," though as he spoke Styrian
I could not understand a word, but his looks and
gestures were as eloquent as words. Having
walked into the little church, first taking off my
hat, the little sexton became quite eloquent, and
pointed out with evident satisfaction to every
part of the chapel, which was poor and desolate in
the extreme. Four white-washed walls, a wretched
altar piece of wood painted in a few gaudy colours, and
a crimson damask baldachino in tatters, which, stowed
away in a corner, served to shelter the "Santissimo"
when carried about in procession, two or three
benches, a confessional box, and a lighted lamp
hanging in front of the altar, constituted <i><span lang="fr_FR">toute la
baraque</span></i>! but the poor little old man seemed delighted
with himself and everything around him,
and kept repeating in a shrill voice the only Italian
word he apparently possessed "<i>Bella</i>," "<i>Bella</i>," to
which I responded as in duty bound, "<i><span lang="it_IT">molto
bella</span></i>," and I trust I may be forgiven the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
cram; for I never told a bigger one in all my
life!
</p>

<p>
The floor of this little church was formed of
large flag-stones, in some of which iron rings were
inserted, while in others there only remained the
marks of where rings had formerly been; some had
inscriptions, and I should have been interested in
hearing something of the ancient tenants of these
graves, but here the sexton and I came completely
to a dead lock. "<i>Bella</i>" could serve my friend
no longer, still he understood perfectly what I
required, so when he sat down on a bench, pointing
to me to do the same, I complied at once, and all
the more willingly as the rain was still coming down
in torrents.
</p>

<p>
The old fellow then commenced, and, pointing
with his skinny finger to the central slab, entered
at once into what, I presume, must have been a
full, true, and complete history of the tenants of that
grave, descanting probably on their virtues, and
dealing gently with their faults; but alas! I could
not understand one word. At last, I suppose the same
thought must have struck "Old Mortality," for
he suddenly stopped and bursting into a shrill,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
unearthly, and most discordant laugh, pointed to
the sky which was now clearing, and held out
his palsied hand, when I discovered he knew
another word, not Slave, nor Italian, but this
time German, "<i>Geschenk!</i>" I gave him the only
bit of silver I possessed, an English sixpence, and
left him seemingly contented.
</p>

<p>
The clouds had all melted away, and the sun
shone brilliantly when I left the little roadside
tavern of San Canziano to return to Trieste; but,
as I wanted to visit a stud-park which the Emperor
of Austria keeps in this part of his dominions, we
took another route on my return journey. The
country we now drove through was prettier than what
we had traversed in the morning, and the road
passed through some fine oak woods, which constantly
prompted one to look out for a mansion,
the country appeared so park-like—but in
vain.
</p>

<p>
After a drive of an hour or so we came to
the stud-farm, a collection of large buildings,
consisting of several dwelling-houses, a spacious riding-house
for exercising the horses in severe weather,
three large stables intended to accommodate three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
hundred mares, and one lofty vaulted stable
fitted with nice large loose boxes in which were
kept the sires. The mares were all out at grass
together with their foals, so that I did not see them,
as I should have had to drive some miles in a
different direction, and turn my back on Trieste
in order to visit them. The sires I did see, but
as they were not led out I could not form as
accurate an opinion of them as I should have
wished. They seemed, however, small, and not
exactly the style of horse we would select in
this country with a view to supplying our cavalry.
The loose-boxes were commodious and the stable
was well-ventilated; the weather being extremely
hot the windows were closed with <i>tatties</i>, which
served the double purpose of keeping away the
flies, which always seek the light, and keeping
the stable cool. The stable was fairly clean,
but the grooming did not come up to our ideas.
On the whole I was disappointed, and as for
the produce, I should think that nothing but the
very lightest of light cavalry horses could be
expected from them.
</p>

<p>
We returned to Trieste by nine o'clock, coming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
by the old post-road from Vienna, and passing
by that wonderful quarry of limestone slabs, perhaps
the largest in the world.

<p class="drop-cap">
On the 2nd of July I was up betimes.
I had taken my place for Zara on
board the 'San Carlo,' a small coasting
steamer which trades down the Dalmatian side of
the Adriatic, going in and out among that archipelago
of islands which fringe the coast of
Dalmatia from the mouth of the Guarnero to the
entrance of the Gulf of Cattaro. It was a small,
slow, and dirty little steamer, but it stopped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
everywhere going on its way, and that was just
what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
Small as the vessel was, we had plenty of
passengers, and a strange lot they were. We had
two Capuchin monks going to Ragusa, one of them
a most interesting man of whom I shall have more
to say by and by; his lay brother, a simple,
ignorant monk, and no more. We had a tall,
handsome Dalmatian from Spalato, returning home
to end his days in opulence and comfort after
spending twenty years in India, where he had
accumulated an independence which in Dalmatia
will be considered a large fortune. He spoke
English remarkably well. Being struck by his
hale and robust looks, I asked him how he had
managed to preserve his health so well after residing
for twenty years in India. "Many of them," added he,
"in unhealthy localities." "Simply by not drinking,"
he answered. "I don't mean to say that I was
a water-drinker—not at all, for I believe that
water-drinking is nearly as bad as spirit-drinking,
and indeed I think I have observed that
those who were 'teatotallers' died even sooner
than drunkards. But I never drank anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
before breakfast, I drank nothing but good, full-bodied
claret, and I never took more than two
bottles of it a day, and seldom so much; I smoked,
but always in moderation, and I never had a day's
illness during those twenty years. India is not a
bad climate, it is the reckless habits of Europeans
that make it apparently so."
</p>

<p>
We had two other Dalmatians from Sebenico,
who also were returning home after residing many
years abroad. These two had been in Australia;
one had been a digger, and seemed the reverse of
well-off; the other had kept a store at some gold-diggings,
and had apparently made plenty of money.
Both spoke English well, and the last one brought
with him from Australia an Irish wife, who had
emigrated to the Antipodes all the way from
Lurgan. She was a fine comely young woman
of about twenty-six, and was overjoyed at finding
I knew her native place. In the afternoon I made
some tea in my portable kitchen, and gave her a
cup of it with some preserved milk, which she
declared the most delicious thing she had tasted
for many a long day.
</p>

<p>
The rest of our passengers consisted of country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
people returning to their homes along the
coast of Istria and Dalmatia, after having been
to Trieste to dispose of the produce of their
lands.
</p>

<p>
As the clocks struck five, we steamed out of
Trieste on one of the finest mornings that could
be imagined. The sea was as smooth as a mirror,
and of the most intense blue. How often we
stopped as we went down the coast of Istria I
cannot tell, as we were constantly heaving to
for the convenience of passengers going on shore
in boats which put off to receive them; we did stop
however at Capo d'Istria, and then at Pirano,
where I was able to take a rough sketch of that
most picturesque little town, with its beautiful
mediæval castle perched on the cliff behind
it.
</p>

<p>
Then we came to Parenzo, where I should very
much have liked to go ashore for a couple of
hours to look at the cathedral, of which I had
heard so much, but unfortunately the little business
the steamer had to transact was done in a few
minutes, and the Captain would not delay (probably
because my bribe was insufficient), so I had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
to comfort myself with the hope of seeing it on
some future occasion, when I trust to be able
again to visit all those spots which interested me
so much then, as also many other places in the
same countries, which accidental circumstances prevented
me from seeing.
</p>

<p>
The Cathedral of Parenzo, which I was so
anxious to see, and which had been described to
me by a friend at Trieste as a <i><span lang="it_IT">meraviglia</span></i>, was
founded by Bishop Eupatius, and completed in the
year 526; it is therefore as old as St. Sophia of
Constantinople, and older than any other Cathedral
in Europe. "It is said to have a semicircular
apse behind the altar, with the Bishop's throne,
and seats on either side for the clergy, instances of
which are now so rarely to be met with."<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>...
</p>

<p>
"At the east end is a round apse, as glorious
in its mosaics as St. Mark's, or St. Sophia. Every
part of the wall and rounded roof is covered with
mosaics, &amp;c. A group of nine saints and angels
surrounding the Blessed Virgin and Child, on a
golden background, is exquisitely done. Heads of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
saints adorn the arches, all are beautiful. Below
these, to about ten feet high, the walls are inlaid
with whole shells of mother-of-pearl let into a dark
brown stone; it looks just like a piece of Damascus
furniture, and though rude it is effective and
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"The flooring of the whole church is of course
mosaic, in Byzantine patterns, the same as in
Murano and St. Mark's; but one can scarcely
look at anything after the wall mosaics, save the
capitals of the columns. The pillars themselves
are of a fine brown marble; the capitals are
identically the same as those in Santa Sophia,
one more exquisitely under-cut than the other
into lace-work of leaves, flowers, birds, &amp;c.;
they are perhaps a little bolder than those of
St. Sophia, but full of life and spirit, not a line
wasted nor a thought thrown away. I longed
to sketch them, but I could only hope they may
one day be photographed; Jerusalem and Constantinople
alone can rival them.
</p>

<p>
"The Baldacchino is exceedingly curious and fine,
as are also the very ancient altar hangings.
There is a splendid altar front, of solid silver
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
gilt, of the Renaissance date. The interest appertaining
to this is that it is placed at the <i>back</i>
of the altar for high mass, facing the Bishop,
who is seated <i>behind the altar</i>, as at Torcello;
this is an ancient and I believe unique privilege.
</p>

<p>
"The Chapel of St. Andrew, at the north-east
corner of the church, is very interesting and
curious. There has been a porch or cloister at the
west entrance, but only two or three columns
remain of it. I venture to think this church
is well worth a special journey from England to see.
I could think of nothing else the rest of the day,
although our onward voyage was full of beauty."<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
We then came to Rovigno with its beautiful
campanile, and here again I could not get half
an hour to go on shore to look at it, though
I believe there is not much more to be seen
beside it.
</p>

<p>
At three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we came in sight of the harbour
of Pola—the Portsmouth of Austria;—but Pola
itself we could not see, as it lies at the bottom
of a bay communicating with the sea by a deep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
and winding channel, apparently well defended by
numerous forts which surround it. The harbour
itself is of very considerable dimensions, and so
deep that the largest vessels can come alongside
the quays.
</p>

<p>
Although so important a place, there did not
appear to be much life or bustle about it. The
country around it is flat and marshy, and sometimes
in the year very unhealthy. It must have
been, however, an important place in the days of
ancient Rome, judging from the size of its amphitheatre,
and the beauty of the Temple and
triumphal arches which still remain, and which
constitute after all the great attractions of Pola.
They are quite close to the landing, so they can be
visited with the utmost facility during the stay
which the steamer generally makes there. The
amphitheatre alone is worth a special visit, as the
exterior of it is perfect, and at a short distance does
not even look like a ruin. It dates from the third
century and is very fine. It consists of a basement
story about four hundred and thirty feet in
length, by three hundred and fifty feet in width,
surmounted by two tiers of arches, with half columns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
of the Tuscan order between each, all about eighty
feet high.
</p>

<p>
Beautifully preserved as is the exterior, the
condition of the interior is most disappointing,
as nothing remains of the internal arrangement
except on one side, the one furthest from the
sea, where there are still a few seats cut in
the rock, some even bearing what most probably
were the initials of their owners carved into
them.
</p>

<p>
What can have caused this utter ruin of all
the accommodation for the spectators? Have the
natives from time to time removed the building
materials from the inside, for the purpose of
building the modern town? not daring to lay
a sacrilegious hand on the shell of the building
itself, which bore no semblance to a ruin, while
at the same time they treated the interior as
a quarry! or were the seats made of woodwork,
and destroyed by fire, as some have
imagined?
</p>

<p>
The steamer always remains long enough to
permit the traveller to visit the amphitheatre and
the temples, as well as the triumphal arches, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
to take a stroll through the Piazza. I did so, and
still further improved the passing hour by eating an
excellent dinner <i>al fresco</i> under a <i>pergola</i> of vines at
the <i>Trattoria</i> of the place.
</p>

<p>
It was just dark as I got on board again, having
been warned by the unmusical steam-whistle that
the vessel would soon be under way again. Just
before starting, a military band came to play
before the Commandant's house, which is on the
quays just opposite to where the steamer was
moored. It being now dark, the band was
accompanied by a score of soldiers carrying a
peculiarly shaped lantern fastened to the top of a
pole, to enable the men to see their music. At
first as the band came marching down the quays
with their lights dancing high up in the air before
and behind, I could not make out what it was,
and only for the liveliness of the music I might
have thought it was a funeral, the whole thing was
very picturesque and the music excellent. At last
we got under way and steamed out of the
harbour on our way to the coast of Dalmatia,
across the Gulf of the Quarnero, so well known
for its dangerous navigation and so much dreaded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
even by the hardy sailors of the Adriatic, when
swept by the fierce impetuous Bora.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for me, who am not the most
intrepid of mariners, and who prefer admiring a
tempestuous sea from off a rocky vantage point
upon the shore, to tossing on its stormy waves,
the dreaded Quarnero was as smooth as a millpond.
The night was magnificent; the heavens
cloudless, and studded with countless stars, but
scarcely as bright as I have seen them at other
times, owing to the intense brilliancy of the
moon now nearly at the full. The track of the
steamer was clearly marked out far in the rear
by a broad phosphorescent wake, while the water
which was dashed off from the paddles seemed like
liquid fire.
</p>

<p>
The cabins were all occupied, so I had to make
my bed on deck; but even if I could have got
one, I never could have slept below, it was so
hot and stuffy. I was soon settled for the night;
a doubled-up rug laid lengthwise on the deck
was my bed, and my dressing-bag was my pillow.
It was so warm that I required no covering save
my light tweed suit, and I was no sooner down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
than I was fast asleep. I don't know how long
I slept; but I would have slept still longer, if I
had not been awoke by the steamer stopping to
put down and take up passengers and goods at
some place on the coast of Dalmatia.
</p>

<p>
We had safely crossed the mouth of the Quarnero,
the moon had set, and the blue black vault of
heaven was studded with countless stars sparkling
like diamonds. The steamer was hove to a little
distance from the shore, while scores of boats, each
with a coloured lantern at the prow, came and
went, making as pretty a scene as can be imagined;
but for all that, after sitting up and admiring it
for a few minutes, I lay down again on my rug,
and falling asleep never awoke again till the sun was
high in the heavens the next morning.
</p>

<p>
By degrees the passengers one by one came on
deck, when by making interest with Giovanni, the
steward, I obtained the use of a <i>camerino</i> (cabin)
to make my toilet in. Having completed my
ablutions I called in Giovanni to empty my tub,
for as the <i>camerino</i> was extremely small it was
next to impossible to stand in it, unless with one's
feet in the water. Never was steward so astonished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
and so puzzled as Giovanni was at the sight of
my flimsy mackintosh tub; he had no idea of how
to take it up to empty it, he was afraid to touch
it until I had taken it up on three sides and showed
him how to lift it, when he was so delighted
with the whole arrangement that he placed it
on the table of the cabin just as it was, and
fetched down the passengers to see the ingenious
English device. By the time it had been well
examined and then emptied, I was up and dressed.
When I came out of the <i>camerino</i>, I showed the
assembled company how it could be rolled up
into the smallest compass, and stowed away in a
travelling bag.
</p>

<p>
There was no regular breakfast on board,
but everyone as he wanted it got a cup of
coffee and a bit of bread or a biscuit; preserved
milk also could be had, but of butter there was
none.
</p>

<p>
Our passengers had somewhat varied since leaving
Trieste. We had deposited many on the coast of
Istria as we went along, and taken up others in
their place. We had a remarkable Oriental-looking
woman, plain perhaps, and yet handsome, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
Montenegrin of rank, a cousin of the present
Prince, dressed in full native costume. She was
on her way to her native country to petition
the Prince to permit certain of his cousins, who
had been expatriated for political causes, to return
to their homes.
</p>

<p>
The costume of the Montenegrin women is not
becoming; even this handsome woman, and the
beautiful Princess whom I subsequently had the
honour of seeing at Montenegro, failed to render
it attractive to my eyes, whereas the costume of the
men is eminently becoming. This lady's dress
consisted of a sort of white chemise of fine lawn,
tight, but gathered very full round the neck,
without any frill, and open down the front for
six or eight inches, where it was closed by a row
of very small buttons. This white garment, which
reached down to the ankles, was fastened round
her waist by a massive silver belt, made in compartments
three inches by four and joined together
by hinges. Each compartment was highly ornamented
with rich <i><span lang="fr_FR">repoussé</span></i> work in <i><span lang="it_IT">alto rilievo</span></i>, and
from a side-piece hung down several ornaments of
the châtelaine species, while from the other side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
depended an exquisite little dagger in a sheath of
silver <i><span lang="fr_FR">repoussé</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
The sleeves of this white garment were tight
at the shoulders, but grew wider and wider as
they approached the wrist, where they were
upwards of two feet six inches in diameter. They
were bordered with a rich margin of embroidery
in gold and silver thread, mingled with red and
blue silk, in excellent taste, and the same embroidery
was continued up the external seam of the
sleeve on the outside of the elbow up to the
shoulder. From below the silver belt she wore
a large apron of rich black silk coming down to
her ankles, and over all a peculiar white cloth
coat without sleeves, the typical garment of the
Montenegrins, both male and female. This coat
was made of a very soft white cloth, so close and
yet soft and pliable, that although sitting next to
her and touching it with my finger, I could not at
once determine if it was cloth or some sort of
beautifully tanned leather. As I said before, this
coat was without sleeves or collar, but scooped
tight to the back of the neck. In front it did
not come further forward than about half way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
between the point of the shoulders and the middle
of the neck, and then straight down like a sack
till just below the calf of the leg. This coat was
bound right round the whole way with a narrow
pattern of embroidery in the same style as round
the sleeves of the muslin dress, and in addition
had a row of very small round silver buttons down
the front on one side. On her head she wore a
very large black Indian silk kerchief fastened into
her hair with pins, and hanging down behind her
back as low as her waist.
</p>

<p>
The costume is decidedly ugly, though containing
the elements of great beauty, if only put
together with taste and harmony. Nothing, for
instance, can be more attractive and becoming than
that black kerchief, be it of silk, gauze or lace,
when gracefully put on the head, as the women
of Spain or Genoa know so well how to wear it;
but the Montenegrin arrangement is as clumsy
and inelegant in the women as it is manly and
picturesque in the men.
</p>

<p>
We had on board also several Austrian officers
going to join their quarters, some to Zara and
some to Cattaro, Budua, and Kosmatch. Very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
nice, pleasant, gentlemanlike fellows they were,
some of them speaking French, but all able to
converse freely in Italian, and all well-informed,
agreeable companions. Acquaintances are made
much more easily abroad than in England, so we
were soon quite at home together, and what with
chatting, smoking and walking up and down the
deck, we quickly passed over the time, till at ten
o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we came in front of Zara, celebrated
in ancient times for its long siege, when "in
1346 Marino Faliero earned his laurels by the
most daring assault," and in modern times for its
excellent Maraschino!
</p>

<p>
Zara is an important place even at the present
time. It is the capital of Dalmatia, and the seat
of the Archbishop of the province. It is well-built,
clean, and tolerably well-paved, and well-worth
a visit. The time, however, allowed by
the stay of the steamer is amply sufficient to
enable one to see it; but the heat was so great
that I felt more inclined to stay on board smoking
cigarettes under the awning of the steamer than
to go on shore. The prospect of some <i><span lang="fr_FR">café à la
glace</span></i>, however, which I knew was to be obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
in the Piazza, added to the more important fact
that I was to receive here a letter for the Archimandrite
of Montenegro, induced me to shake off
my apathy.
</p>

<p>
Having landed on the quay, I passed through
the gate over which is sculptured the grim effigy
of the Lion of St. Mark, everywhere seen down
the Eastern shores of the Adriatic wheresoever the
Venetians had established their authority, I proceeded
to execute my plans; but the heat was so
intense that I was glad to come back to the steamer
where I imagined it was something less stifling.
But this day was unusually hot and close, and
with the exception of one at Cattaro, when the
thermometer registered at four o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
105° Fahrenheit, was the hottest I experienced in
all my journey.

<p class="drop-cap">
AT about one o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we steamed
away from Zara while we were at
dinner, and at five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> reached Sebenico.
Should I ever travel again in
that part of the world, I think I should try to go
from Zara to Sebenico by land in order to see the
ruins of Asseria, which I learnt afterwards were
well worth a visit; but the journey should in that
case be undertaken earlier in the year, to avoid the
oppressive heats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The afternoon between leaving Zara and arriving
at Sebenico passed quickly away, for I had the
advantage of two most agreeable companions; one
the capuchin monk, the other a charming young
fellow, an officer in an Austrian Jäger regiment,
Baron Heyd von Heydeg.
</p>

<p>
The Capuchin was a most interesting man, and
we chatted many an hour together by moonlight on
the deck, when every one else had gone to sleep,
when I used to chaff him about the rules of his
order, which forbid the smoking of tobacco, while
they permit the use of snuff without any restriction.
He used to take it most good-humouredly,
and laughed as if his sides would split
when I would refuse to take a pinch of his snuff
unless he smoked one of my cigarettes. I verily
think I should have brought him round at last,
had he not been constantly under the surveillance,
and in mortal "<i><span lang="it_IT">soggezione</span></i>" of his lay
brother.
</p>

<p>
Heyd was a different fellow altogether, but
most agreeable. He was going to join his regiment,
then quartered at Budua. We travelled
together as far as Cattaro, and I met him subsequently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
both at Cettigne and Budua, where I
went expressly to pay him a visit.
</p>

<p>
The time sped swiftly and most agreeably in
spite of the heat, and at five o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we
steamed through the narrow tortuous opening,
bordered by steep rocky sides, which leads into
the bay, at the further end of which stands
Sebenico. It is a noble harbour, and so deep
that a frigate can lie alongside the quay. At
the narrowest part of its entrance, the approach
is defended by what a few years ago would have
been considered a masterpiece of fortification, but
which at present would offer too fair a target to
our projectiles to afford any great protection against
an enemy. It is still worth a visit, as its casemates
are perhaps among the finest in the world.
It was engineered and built in 1546, by the celebrated
architect San Micheli. The entrance to the
fortress is surmounted by the usual Venetian Lion
with the following inscription:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"<span lang="la">Pax tibi Marce Evangelista meus</span>."<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Having landed with Baron Heyd, who had been
quartered there some time before, for cicerone, I proceeded
to inspect the Duomo, or cathedral, the
principal object of interest there. Some people
are lost in admiration of this cathedral, I really
could not see much about it to admire, and the two
statues on its façade representing Adam and Eve
(they might as well be Gog and Magog) are simply
detestable. But the roof of the cathedral is a
curiosity in itself, and worth the journey. It
is of its kind unique, and though it is said to
be perfectly safe, and I suppose must be so,
having continued so for so many years, still I could
not help feeling a sense of insecurity as long as I
was in the church, and enjoyed great relief when I
finally came out of it.
</p>

<p>
This roof is simply a semi-cylinder made of
enormous slabs of stone joined edge to edge, but
so beautifully adapted and fitted one into the
other that, without any other support save what
they afford each other, they form the vault of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
cathedral. I trust they may never crack; but I,
for one, could never say my prayers with comfort
under such a roof.
</p>

<p>
Having taken a ramble through the streets, which
were clean and contained many fine mansions, we
went up to the fort on the hill behind the town,
and which commands the whole place, where we
passed a pleasant hour with the officers of the
garrison.
</p>

<p>
My time being limited, I was unable to make
an expedition from Sebenico, which under different
circumstances I should certainly have undertaken,
that is to the falls of the Kerka and the monastery
above them. My friend, the Capuchin, who had
travelled a good deal both in Europe and America,
and had a good eye for the picturesque, told me
they were well worth seeing; but like many
other interesting spots down that coast, I
must only hope to visit them at some future
time.
</p>

<p>
At dusk we returned to the steamer, though
we knew it would not leave till the following
morning early, and we could have spent a most
pleasant night on shore; but Sebenico shuts its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
gates at sunset, and then till the following sunrise
no one can come in or go out, and had we
attempted it we should only have lost our
passage.
</p>

<p>
Having partaken of an excellent supper, I
returned to the deck, where, as was my wont, I
sat down beside my friend the Capuchin, who
always took a cup of coffee with me though he
would not consent to smoke. We chatted till very
late, when he went down to his <i>camerino</i>, and I
settled myself on deck as usual for my night's sleep.
It turned out awfully hot, as the steamer remained
till break of day in the harbour of Sebenico, but
what must it have been in the cabin?
</p>

<p>
At the very earliest dawn we left our moorings,
and steamed out of the harbour by its well guarded
entrance. Just outside we passed a group of small
islands, among which is established a considerable
coral fishery. The coral is not however of the
finest quality, mostly of the common deep red
kind, and is principally sold on the spot or at
the fair of Sinigaglia in the Romagna on the
opposite or Italian side of the Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was just merging into daylight, when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
we steamed out of that land-locked harbour. It
had been stiflingly hot as long as we had lain still
alongside the quay, but the moment we came out
into the open sea, the
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span lang="it_IT">Aura messaggiera</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p><span lang="it_IT">Ad annunziar che se ne vien l'Aurora</span>,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="post">
came with a most refreshing breeze, so light, however,
as not even to raise a "cat's paw" on the
glassy waters, but still deliciously cool and invigorating.
</p>

<p>
The steward was not long manufacturing me a
good cup of coffee, after which, having made
myself comfortable in a capital arm-chair, I again
went to sleep, not to awake until Giovanni summoned
me again, "<span lang="it_IT">per far colazione</span>."
</p>

<p>
In the course of the morning we reached
Spalato, a beautiful and most interesting place,
where an artist could with advantage spend many
days. It was celebrated in ancient times for the
gorgeous palace which the Emperor Diocletian
built for himself after abdicating the Empire in
303 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and the magnificent remains of which
still form the glory of the present city. After a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
reign of twenty years, "Diocletian executed his
memorable resolution of abdicating the Empire,"
and acquired the glory of giving to the world the
most remarkable, if not the first, example of a
resignation which has not been very frequently
imitated by succeeding monarchs. Withdrawing
to Salona, he passed the last nine years of his life
in seclusion—the building of a palace in the
neighbourhood, and the superintendence of his
garden, occupying his leisure hours. The
satisfaction he derived from these pursuits is
sufficiently proved by his well-known answer to
Maximian, when urging him to re-assume the
purple, "If I could show you the cabbages I have
planted with my own hands at Salona, you would
no longer urge me to relinquish the enjoyment of
happiness for the pursuit of power."
</p>

<p>
This immense palace, which covered very nearly
nine English acres of ground, was almost a perfect
square terminating at the four corners by a quadrangular
tower. Its faces were directed as nearly
as possible to the four cardinal points—the southern
side being pointed to the shore and facing the sea.
It still exists in good preservation and forms a grand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
object of attraction to the visitor entering the
harbour. Two streets intersected each other at
right angles nearly in the centre of it, which has
lately been completely excavated and is now fully
exposed to view.
</p>

<p>
The following description by the late Mr. Paton
(author of "Highlands and Islands of the Adriatic,"
one of the most charming books ever printed)
will convey to the reader a far clearer impression
than anything I could pen; I therefore make
no apology for inserting it here, and whoever
should wish to go still deeper into the matter
and learn all that is to be learned concerning
this palace, I refer him to Mr. Adams' book
"Spalato Restored," which is a perfectly exhaustive
treatise on the subject.
</p>

<p>
"At the outset we are struck with the enormous
extent of the palace, which is not less
than nine acres and a half; so that even Constantine
Porphyrogenitus speaks of it with admiration,
as one of the greatest edifices then extant.
In the time of Diocletian, his great retinue and
a pretorian cohort could be lodged with convenience
in it. Sixteen towers gave strength and elegance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
to the edifice, of which the largest were those
at the four corners. The back of the edifice looked
to the north-east on the land-side, and there was the
principal entrance, the Porta Aurea, or golden gate,
which led to the Peristylium, a great court of
granite columns; and the cross street which intersected
the principal passage at right angles was
terminated at each end by gates, the one the
Porta Ferrea, or iron gate, the other the Porta
Ænea, or gate of brass, which are so called to this
day.
</p>

<p>
"This peristylium, or court of granite columns,
was flanked by two temples; the greater of Jupiter,
and the smaller of Esculapius; the former, a
lofty octagon, was ascended by a stair of fifteen
steps; an uneven number being generally found in
the temples of the ancients, that, beginning to
move with the right foot, they might, of course,
place it first upon the uppermost step in order to
enter the temple—a form which was accounted
respectful in approaching the Deity. From the
peristylium, or court of granite columns, the Roman
entered the principal inhabited part of the palace;
first was the porticus of Corinthian order, then the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
circular dome-covered vestibulum, with the Lares
and Penates; then the atrium, or quadrangular
hall, ninety-eight by forty-five with its arms and
trophies dedicated to ancestry; and last of all
the crypto-porticus, or grand gallery, looking to
the south-west, thus facing the sea, and forming
a noble promenade of five hundred and fifteen feet
in length, in which, during the heat of Summer
or inclemency of Winter, the Emperor could take
exercise. This crypto-porticus was the principal
feature of the palace, and the well-known taste
of Diocletian leads us to suppose that the choicest
statuary and paintings of the Old World must have
adorned its walls. The relics of Pompeii give
some idea of the classic fancy in ornament, the
harmonizing contrasts in colour, and the consummate
skill in tessellation employed in the domestic
architecture of the ancients; and if we relieve these
splendours with the latest fascination in the
unpretending forms of Greek statuary, how puny
is the utmost magnificence of Versailles compared
with the dwelling of the retired Roman!
</p>

<p>
"Such was the Palace of Diocletian; what now
remains of the edifice? The shell or outer wall,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
of which the best preserved part is the grand
gallery facing the sea; for Spalato like its
contemporary Baalbec being used as a fortification,
the rough stone and mortar of the middle-age
battlements surmount in many places the massive
normal masonry of the Roman Empire....
Within the town, fragments of Roman architecture
are scattered thickly enough, but so obscured and
mingled with modern houses as to present a mass
of confusion."
</p>

<p>
Did we stop short here, the reader might well
imagine that beyond the shell, the walls which
surrounded the palace, nothing has been preserved;
such however is not the case, and I shall now
endeavour to describe what I saw in Spalato the
morning that I steamed into its harbour, when from
the deck of my vessel I gazed on that sea studded
all over with numberless boats spreading the most
fantastic sails to the gentlest of breezes!
</p>

<p>
The prevailing form, if not the only one, was the
lateen in all its varieties, most of the boats carrying
but one. But such colours and such devices
painted on them! things that would look simply
outrageous at Cowes or Ryde, how lovely they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
seemed there! Some were striped from above
downwards with every colour of the rainbow, but
only two colours to each sail and these always
harmoniously contrasted; others of one uniform
colour, with some fantastic ornament in sharp
contrast in the middle; while some, all of one colour
had at the topmost angle of the lateen a representation
of the sun generally in burnished gold with its
rays coming down a long way over the sail. The
glittering golden sea, those fairy-looking boats
gliding over it, the picturesque costumes of the
sailors, the whole scene bathed in that golden light
was a fit preparation for my introduction to the rare
beauties of Spalato itself.
</p>

<p>
As we slowly approached the quay, there was
ample time to admire the long façade of Diocletian's
Palace, with the tall and elegant campanile which
rises inside it on the right, and the strong hexagonal
machicolated tower on the left. The lofty steeple
on the right, a very Giralda of elegance and
airiness—the dungeon on the left a sturdy emblem
of the iron-fisted middle ages.
</p>

<p>
After some customary formalities, during which
I feasted my eyes on the picturesque groups that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
crowded on the quay, permission was finally given
to go ashore; when crossing as quickly as could be
the narrow intervening space, I plunged through the
Porta Ferrea into the vaulted passage which on this
side gives entrance to the city of Spalato; and now
commence the real difficulties of description, but
having undertaken it I must only try, trusting to the
kind forbearance of my readers.
</p>

<p>
This vaulted entrance is narrow, perhaps not twelve
feet wide, but very lofty and formed of immense
blocks of stone put together with wonderful
accuracy. After following it a little way, it opens
out into a spacious round hall rising up to a
considerable height, this portion being unroofed;
from it open out several streets, all running about
here and there, crossing and recrossing each other
as if in search of light and air. The dwellings
in these streets are full of quaint artistic beauty;
at one point one meets a massive wall of square-cut
blocks dating from the days of Diocletian, against
which, perhaps, is built up a modern house with
wrought-iron balconies of the most delicate
workmanship; further on, an outside staircase of
rude stone steps, partly covered with a roof of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
russet tiles, leads to a door some thirty feet above
our heads, from which a flying buttress crosses
over to an opening in an ancient wall beyond, where
a modern habitation has been constructed in some
mediæval donjon.
</p>

<p>
Each turn brings a new surprise, and so one
passes on till one comes to the piazza, and this
day being a festival, it swarmed with natives from
all the surrounding <i><span lang="it_IT">campagne</span></i>. The reader must
now come with me to the <i><span lang="fr_FR">café</span></i>, where under a
thick awning and surrounded by a screen of
oleanders and orange-trees in full bloom, we shall
take a <i><span lang="it_IT">granita di caffé</span></i> (a water-ice flavoured with
coffee), and study the moving panorama before us,
whilst we slowly puff away a cigarette made with
the ambrosial tobacco of Trebigna—a kind still
unknown in London and in Paris!

<p class="drop-cap">
SITTING down cross-legged on the
very oldest and dirtiest of rugs, and
just outside our fragrant hedge of
oleander, is to be seen an old Jew,
the finest type of a Shylock that could be imagined;
with ample, heavy, flowing beard, aquiline nose
with sharp cut nostril, and deep-set piercing eyes
shadowed by an ample turban. He has before him,
on his rug, a collection of arms, pistols of the old
approved Turkish form and yataghans of every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
price, from the common horn-handled weapon in a
wooden sheath to the jewel-hilted Kharjar in a
sheath of <i><span lang="fr_FR">repoussé</span></i> silver. Around is a motley
group of countrymen, all talking at the top of
their voices in their several languages, whilst
examining and praising or depreciating the weapons
there for sale, just as they are either simple <i><span lang="fr_FR">flâneurs</span></i>
in the square, or really intending purchasers. The
varieties of costume rendered this picturesque
group most interesting, there were Morlacchi from
the neighbouring mountains with full blue Turkish
trowsers fast to the knee; gold embroidered
crimson jackets without sleeves, and gaiters to
match; the whole finished off by an immense Albanian
scarf of many colours wound round the waist,
holding a perfect armoury of weapons in the front.
On the head most of them wore a small red fez,
others wore a turban, but it was not put on like
the Jews, they did not seem <i><span lang="fr_FR">au fait</span></i> in settling it;
but whatever head-gear they adopted they all were
decorated with a tail—a genuine plaited tail coming
down their backs with such luxuriance that it might
have been the envy of any Celestial. I could not
bring myself to like it—though report says that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
the Morlacchi are wonderfully attached to their
tails, and cherish and pet them somewhat in the
manner of our old tars in the days of Collingwood
and Nelson.
</p>

<p>
There were Turks from the Herzegovina, ill-looking,
badly-clad, scowling Mussulmans, who
would willingly have earned ten paras by sending
a Christian to his latter home, but still gorgeous
in their tatters and vermin. There were Christian
Albanians with their white fustanellas, high aquiline
nose, glittering eyes, and false smile, in dress
somewhat similar to the Morlacchi, but wearing a
smaller fez with a long blue tassel. Conspicuous
above them all was a Risanese from the Gulf of
Cattaro, in full Montenegrin costume; but with
a green instead of the white characteristic coat, all
overladen about the breast and shoulders with
plates of solid gold of considerable thickness,
especially over the shoulders, where they would,
if required, afford some protection from the blow of
a sabre.
</p>

<p>
Mingled with the men were several women—some
very good-looking—with golden-brown hair
and dark eyes and eyelashes; their hair in plaits,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
not hanging but coiled round their heads, which
were further adorned with Turkish piastres and
other coins. The dress is a mixture of red, white,
and blue artistically combined, with coral and
coins twisted round their necks.
</p>

<p>
The noise of this Babel of tongues was deafening,
and the scene not to be described. One wretched,
tattered old man, but armed to the teeth like the
rest, long tried to persuade me to buy a hank
of onions, and would not be gainsaid when told by
one of the waiters of the <i><span lang="fr_FR">café</span></i> that I was a traveller
and did not require onions; what better or more
portable provisions could I carry with me in my
travels than onions? said he.
</p>

<p>
Having finished my <i><span lang="it_IT">granita</span></i>, I again started
to explore the city; this time under the guidance of
a most obliging gentleman, well versed in the
antiquities of the place, and to whom I had brought
an introduction. We first went outside the city
to inspect the grand Porta Aurea. This had only
lately been thoroughly excavated, and even in its
present dilapidated condition, not so much the
effect of time as of the plundering propensities of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
man, is still most beautiful and grand. What
must it have been before the eight columns which
decorated its front were taken away to adorn some
modern church?
</p>

<p>
From the Porta Aurea, we again got into the
city, proceeding straight to the court of the vestibule
of the Palace, where all that is best worth seeing
in Spalato is collected together. Here in front of
us was the façade of the peristyle, consisting of
four large and beautiful granite columns, supporting
a triangular pediment, and which occupied the
whole breadth of the court. On each side were
a row of six Corinthian columns, equally large, and
also of rose-coloured Egyptian granite, supporting
not an architrave as is generally the case, but a
series of arches which sprang from their capitals.
On the right was the smaller temple, dedicated to
Esculapius, now converted into a baptistry, and dedicated
to St. John. On the left, the Temple of
Jupiter—now the Cathedral of Spalato, by the side
of which rises that most elegant campanile, the
Giralda of Spalato, only one hundred and ninety-nine
feet high, since the two upper stories were
thrown down by lightning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The interior of the Cathedral does not offer
much to admire—nevertheless its general effect is
sufficiently imposing. But it is outside in the court,
the present piazza, that all the beauty of the place
reveals itself. It is not a ruin—of the sixteen
original granite columns not one has been displaced,
and this portion of the Palace of Spalato
is as in the days when Diocletian came into his
Temple to pray. Can the reader believe that all
this is really within five days of London?
</p>

<p>
Dalmatia has been the birthplace of many men
of letters and science, and Spalato can boast of
having even given a Protestant Dean to our royal
Windsor, in the person of the celebrated Mark
Anthony de Dominis, once Catholic Archbishop
of Spalato, whose life and death would furnish
materials for a sensational novel. As his history
is not commonly known, it may, perhaps, interest
some of my readers to hear it now.
</p>

<p>
He was born about the year 1570, and educated
at the Illyrian College of the Jesuits, in Loretto,
from whence he passed to Padua, where he became
Professor of Mathematics. In the year 1600, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
was created Bishop of Segna, and in 1602 he was
raised to the Archbishopric of Spalato, where,
during the terrible plague of 1607, he nobly distinguished
himself by his liberality to the poor, and
his fearless and humane attendance on the sick in
the administration of his sacerdotal duties—emulating
the courage and devotion, under similar
circumstances, of Borromeo of Milan. He occupied
the Archiepiscopal throne of Spalato for fourteen
years, during which period his time was divided
between the performance of his ecclesiastical duties,
and the investigations of science. He converted
the upper part of the Palace, at Spalato, into a
Laboratory and an Observatory, and the window
is still shown where he is supposed to have made
the discovery of the prismatic colour of light, "by
the falling drops of water;" which discovery, including
a description of the nature of the rainbow,
he published to the world in a work printed at
Venice in 1611. His fickleness in matters of
religion, however, proved his ruin; his Chapter
accused him of heretical opinions, upon which he
withdrew to Venice at the close of 1615, having
previously vacated his See in favour of his nephew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
Sforza Ponsoni. During his residence in that city,
he wrote a work in favour of the Republic, which
was condemned by the Inquisition, when he determined
on withdrawing, for safety, to a Protestant
country.
</p>

<p>
He went first to Heidelberg, and thence came
to England in the suite and at the invitation of
Sir Henry Wotton, Ambassador of James I. to the
Venetian Republic. In England, he published and
dedicated to James I. a history of the Council of
Trent, which had been lent him, it is said, by its
author, Fra Paolo Sarpi. He also edified the
Protestant public by an open recantation of his
religion in St. Paul's Cathedral, and then published
a work against the Papacy, entitled, "Scoglio del
Naufragio Christiano." He was particularly well
received in England; and was patronized by the
King, who made him Dean of Windsor. He
seems, however, to have expected more, and to
have been disappointed at not getting a bishopric;
and on Gregory XV., who was a friend and relative
of his, succeeding him to the Papal throne,
he changed his religion again, and yielding to the
solicitations of the Pope, conveyed to him through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
the Spanish Ambassador, who promised him a Cardinal's
Hat, he returned to Rome in 1622.
</p>

<p>
Gregory XV. received him kindly, and as long
as he lived De Dominis remained unmolested, but
at his death Pope Urban VIII., who succeeded
him, saw no reason to extend his protection over
the ex-Protestant Dean of Windsor; he was accused
of heresy, handed over to the tender mercies of
the Holy Inquisition, and thrown into a dungeon
of the Castle of St. Angelo, where he died in 1625—it
is supposed by poison, and his body was subsequently
burned, together with his writings, in the
Campo dei Fiori.
</p>

<p>
De Dominis was a very distinguished philosopher,
and we must not be too severe when judging him
by the light of the present day. There can be
no doubt that the change from Popery to the Reformed
religion was principally due, not to a feeling
of animosity against the Church of Rome, as many
have maintained, but chiefly to those doubts
concerning the truth of the things taught by
that church, and to its conduct in persisting to
refuse the results of the investigations of science,
as evinced by its treatment of Galileo and others.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
His return to the church is more difficult to
account for on generous grounds; but he, himself,
is stated to have said that by becoming a
Cardinal he might be of greater use in effecting a
reformation in that community to which he had
originally belonged. The Holy Inquisition had
hoped to have enjoyed the satisfaction of publicly
roasting, "<span lang="la">ad majorem Dei gloriam</span>," a professor of
Natural Science, a renegade Catholic Archbishop and
a Protestant Dean all in one; but some charitable
friend robbed that holy confraternity of its anticipated
triumph by passing in some poison to the
unfortunate De Dominis, who learnt too late that
Rome never changes, "<span lang="it_IT">che il Lupo perde il pelo, il
vizio no</span>" and that according to Papal ethics to keep
faith with heretics is at best a grievous sin.
</p>

<p>
Spalato, in common with the rest of Dalmatia,
has given birth to many able men, among which
they claim even St. Jerome, the most learned of
the ancient fathers and the talented author of the
noblest translation of the Bible; but I fear on
insufficient grounds, as all the authorities I have
looked into seem to make him a Pannonian and
not an Illyrian; Carrara, however, claims him as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
a compatriot in his "<span lang="it_IT">Uomini Illustri di Spalato</span>."
</p>

<p>
Within a few miles of Spalato are the ruins of
Salona, I had not time to visit them. There is not
comparatively very much of interest to be seen
above ground, but I believe that methodically
conducted diggings have yielded some valuable
results. It was the Roman capital of Dalmatia and
was destroyed by the Avars in 640, when the
inhabitants who escaped from the slaughter took
refuge in Spalato and there founded the new city,
by grouping themselves around and under the
protection of the Palace of Diocletian.
</p>

<p>
The majority of the inhabitants of Spalato are
Roman Catholics, with an admixture of Greeks and
a good number of Jews, who wear the turban and
the Oriental costume, and are principally descended
from those who were expelled from Spain in 1493.
For many centuries they were subjected to the same
indignities as in other Christian countries, and compelled
to inhabit the Ghetto where they used to be
locked up at night; but such practices have long
been abolished in Dalmatia, and the Jews of Spalato
have enjoyed for many years the same privileges as
the other citizens of that place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My stay at Spalato was much too short for
enjoyment; I saw indeed most that was to be seen
there, but it was not much more than a glance,
and I longed to be sketching amongst those picturesque
nooks.
</p>

<p>
Having several times mentioned the Morlacchi,
it will, I think, be interesting to my readers to
know something about them. Again I have to
regret that I was unable to visit them in their
villages, and that the only information I can give
of them is, that they are inhabitants of the wild
mountainous district lying to the East of Dalmatia.
They are a fine race of men, though much smaller
and inferior to the Montenegrin; their women, on
the contrary, are often very beautiful, and they
have many strange customs in their dealings with
foreigners which would make an excursion into
the fastnesses of their mountains of more than
ordinary interest.
</p>

<p>
With the Lowland Dalmatians and the inhabitants
of the towns on the coast, the name of
Morlacchi is always associated with plunder and
cattle-lifting, just as in Scotland a hundred years
ago every Highlander, in the eyes of a Lowlander,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
was a cateran and a robber; but I heard from
people that had been among them, that they are
very hospitable, and that their country can be
freely traversed in any direction without the
smallest danger. They are Catholics and apparently
of the same stock as the Montenegrins, though these
latter are schismatic Greeks.

<p class="drop-cap">
EARLY in the afternoon we left Spalato,
and steaming away from the coast we
stood out to sea, making for Lissa, a
large island of the Adriatic, celebrated
in the days of the first Napoleon for the stout
sea fight in which, on the 13th of March 1811,
Captain Hoste, (afterwards Sir William Hoste),
with four ships mounting 156 guns, utterly defeated
the French fleet of twenty-seven sail, mounting 284,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
having on board 500 troops. In 1808 we occupied
Lissa, and having established free trade and other
institutions, the island improved so much under our
administration that in less than three years from
the time we occupied it the population had risen
to 12,000 inhabitants (at present it has scarcely
5000).
</p>

<p>
The French were naturally sorely tried by the
advantageous position we occupied in front of their
coast, and the very good use we made of our
opportunities of pushing our commerce in every
direction. They determined therefore on expelling
us from Lissa and the Adriatic, as from the smallness
of our armament there they had no doubt as
to their success. Swiftly and silently they fitted out
an expedition at Ancona, which under the command
of the brave Captain Dubourdieu arrived at Lissa
on the 13th March, 1811. It consisted of four
44 gun frigates, ten 32 gun corvettes, one 16 gun
brig, a schooner, ten gun-boats, and a xebeque, in
all 284 guns.
</p>

<p>
The British Squadron consisted of only four
ships, the 'Amphion,' 'Active,' 'Cerberus,' and
'Volage,' mounting but 156 guns all told, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
was commanded and manned by British seamen!
the result could not be doubted, and although
Dubourdieu fought like a gallant sailor as he was,
the victory remained with us. Our losses were
severe, and in a quiet retired little nook, on the
left hand as one enters the land-locked harbour of
Lissa, are buried those who fell in that engagement;
while on the right hand side is another
burial place, where under a handsome sepulchral
monument lie the remains of those Austrians who
fell in the latest naval engagement at Lissa when a
few years ago the Italian Navy, the pet toy, an
expensive one by the by, of King Victor Emmanuel,
was all but annihilated by the Austrians under
Admiral Tegethoff.
</p>

<p>
At Lissa we remained a very short time, so
short that I had not even time to go ashore, though
I should have very much liked to visit the burial
place of those brave English sailors who fell in the
naval action of 1811. The business of the
steamer, which seemed principally to consist in
shipping a bridal party, was soon concluded, and
after a very short stay we were again under full
steam for Lesina, another island of the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
archipelago, but much smaller and closer in to the
Dalmatian coast.
</p>

<p>
The bridal party we had taken on board consisted
of the bride and bridegroom, both very plain and
very much, even tawdrily over-dressed in Parisian
costume, and with remarkably dirty hands and
otherwise unwashed appearance. A bishop with
a couple of priests in attendance on his reverence,
and half-a-dozen relations and friends of the newly-married
couple, who seemed principally to study
not to take any notice of each other but went
about making themselves generally agreeable.
</p>

<p>
The groom most kindly insisted on my smoking
his cigars (and villainously bad they were,
but had I declined them he would have been
awfully offended) and drinking his maraschino,
which fortunately was as good as his cigars were
bad, whilst the bride, luckily for me, persistently
avoided me, probably from fear of heretical contamination,
and exclusively devoted her attentions
to the Bishop and his priests.
</p>

<p>
After a few hours steaming through the smoothest
and bluest of seas, in full view of the grand mountains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
of Dalmatia, in due time we arrived at
Lesina a little before sunset. This island is said
to derive its name from being somewhat shaped
like an awl, in Italian <i><span lang="it_IT">lesina</span></i>. It is just a thin strip
of land forty-two miles long, blunt at one end
(which represents the handle) and sharp at the
other. I doubt, however, the correctness of its
etymology, and am inclined to think that its
present name is more probably derived from its
ancient one of "Pharos Insula," often reduced by
elision into simply "Insula;" now the anagram
of "Insula" is "Lusina," a word much more in
harmony with the genius of the Italian language,
and from Lusina to Lesina is but a shade. I think
I am fortified in this etymology by the fact of
at least two other instances in the Adriatic
of this identical transposition of letters, and
the conversion of Insula to Lusina, in the names
of two islands near the Quarnero, named
respectively Lussin Grande and Lussin Piccolo,
which are evidently the anagram of Insula Grande
and Insula Piccola.
</p>

<p>
We arrived just in time to enjoy the effect of
the setting sun upon that rocky landscape and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
exquisitely pretty town at the foot of the mountain,
and sufficiently early to be able to take a
rapid sketch just as the sun was beginning to sink
behind the tower which rises to the west of the
town. The fort behind and above the town was
still in full sunlight, as was also the more distant
fortress of San Nicolo, brought forcibly into relief
by a bank of dark purple clouds which were massed
behind it. Down below, close to the water's
edge, lay the town bathed in a flood of amber light,
partly caused by the reflection of the golden sunset
beyond, and partly by the colouring of the town
itself, the houses of which are all painted with the
warmest tints.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the town, close to the water's
edge, are the "Loggie" or Portico, an elegant
building, which in the olden times of Venetian
supremacy was used by the merchants as an exchange
to transact business in, as well as a hall of
justice for the administration of the laws, and at
the back a room is still shown where criminals
and suspected persons underwent the question by
torture.
</p>

<p>
Immediately behind and above the Loggie rises
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
Fort Spagnuolo, built by Charles V, connected
with the town below by two long crenelated walls,
enclosing in front a considerable space planted thick
with colossal aloes (<i>Agave Americana</i>), which in
case of assault would, in olden times, have offered
a very considerable impediment to the advance of
troops.
</p>

<p>
The island of Lesina is barren, and its commerce
very insignificant; it grows, however, an immense
quantity of rosemary, from which is distilled a
celebrated essential oil <i>Oleum Anthos</i>, and the <i>Aqua
Regia</i>, or rosemary water, which are both largely
exported.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when we left; shaping our way for
Curzola where we arrived about midnight. My
friend, the Capuchin, who sat chatting with me
till we arrived there, regretted I could not
see it by daylight, as contrary to the other
islands, which are conspicuous for their barrenness,
Curzola is well wooded, and is celebrated
for the size and magnificence of its pine
trees.
</p>

<p>
We did not make any long delay here, and
were soon threading our course again between the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
islands and the mainland in the direction of
Ragusa, but I know nothing about them. The
Monk wished me good-night and went to his
cabin, when again I took my usual place on deck,
and was soon as comfortably asleep on that oaken
plank as if I had been in the most luxurious bed
in England.
</p>

<p>
I was awakened from my night's sleep by my
friend the Capuchin monk, who had been my
travelling companion all the way from Trieste.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, my lazy friend," said he, touching me
with his foot. "We shall soon be entering
the port of Gravosa; and there," stretching, out his
arm towards the Dalmatian coast, "is the island of
Lachroma, once the property of the unfortunate
Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, and in ancient times
a harbour of refuge to your great King Richard,
Cœur-de-Lion."
</p>

<p>
Hard though my bed had been, for nothing but
my doubled up old rug had interposed between
myself and the deck, I had slept profoundly, "<i><span lang="fr_FR">à la
belle étoile</span></i>," and far more comfortably than if I had
condescended to take my place in the dirty and
stuffy <i><span lang="it_IT">camerino</span></i> down below, where all the other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
passengers, including my friend the Capuchin
and his lay-brother, fearing bad smells, fleas, and
other small game much less than the delicious
night-air of the balmy Adriatic, had carefully stowed
themselves away the previous night. I was up in
an instant, and I shall not easily forget the sight
that greeted my eyes from the deck of the little
'San Carlo.'
</p>

<p>
We were about three miles from the shore; the
sun, though high above the horizon, had not yet
acquired sufficient force to destroy the freshness of
the morning breeze which delicately rippled the
surface of the sea, making it in the sunshine like
a sheet of frosted gold, while in the shade it was
like liquid sapphire. On my left rose the wild,
rocky cliffs of Dalmatia, rendered still more desolate-looking
by the almost total absence of vegetation;
while in front and on my right, stretching
away to the extreme verge of the horizon, were
the sparkling waters of the Adriatic, thickly
studded with countless islets, to the nearest of
which, Lachroma, the Monk had drawn my
attention.
</p>

<p>
"It is now many years," said the Capuchin,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
"since your great crusading King found a refuge
in that island."
</p>

<p>
"I was not aware that King Richard was shipwrecked
here," said I. "I knew that he met with
a terrific storm in this sea on his return from
Palestine, but I always imagined he had been
wrecked near the top of the Adriatic, on
the coast of Istria, in the neighbourhood of
Aquileia."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the Monk, "it is not generally
known that it was on the rocks of Lachroma that
Cœur-de-Lion was cast away; and it is strange how
this error should have crept into history and held
its ground and place in every standard work,
including your own invaluable Cyclopædias. But
we have ample proofs of the truth of what I am
telling you, and documentary evidence to establish
the accuracy of my assertion; for your King, in
gratitude to Divine Providence for delivering him
from shipwreck, vowed to build a church in
honour of the Blessed Virgin, on whatever land
he should first set foot, and having safely landed
at Lachroma, he proceeded to make good his vow
by committing to the abbot and monks of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
Benedictine monastery, which already existed on
the island, the task of building this church, to
defray the expenses of which the good King devoted
no less than 100,000 <i><span lang="la">nummi argentei</span></i>, which sum
he borrowed from his British lieges. But the
Rettore of Ragusa (so the President of that ancient
Republic was styled), having heard of King
Richard's shipwreck opposite his city, went to visit
him in state, with all the magistrates and councillors
of the Republic, and invited him to Ragusa, where
he was received with every demonstration of
respect, and all the hospitality and attention due
to so distinguished a guest.
</p>

<p>
King Richard, pleased at the reception given
him by the Republicans, and charmed by the
attractive graces of the Ragusan ladies, rested there
for some time; and then at the suggestion of these
fair ones and the urgent entreaties of the authorities,
who promised to obtain a dispensation for him from
the Pope, he altered the terms of his donation, and
founded in Ragusa itself the church to the Blessed
Virgin which he had originally vowed on the
island of Lachroma; on the condition, however, that
the Benedictine Abbot of Lachroma, assisted by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
monks of his convent, should have the privilege
and the right to celebrate mass in this church in
Ragusa every year on the day of the feast of the
Purification. The gift of Richard Cœur-de-Lion
having been further increased by donations from the
inhabitants, this votive church grew into that
celebrated cathedral which for so many years held
the first rank among all the churches of Illyria.<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
At last, however, came one fatal morning, the 6th
of April, 1667, when Ragusa was all but annihilated
by an earthquake. In a few moments all the
principal edifices in the town were laid low, including
the Cathedral of King Richard, and upwards of six
thousand inhabitants, more than one-fifth of the
entire population were buried in the ruins. There
was not a family in the whole city which had not
one or more to mourn for. Several of my ancestors
perished, and among others a lineal ancestor of my
mother, Simone Ghetaldi, then Rettore of the
Republic; he and several senators were assembled
in the Council Chamber, and about to receive the
visit of a Dutch Embassy (which had stopped at
Ragusa on its way to Constantinople, to which
court it was accredited) when they were all engulphed;
not one escaped, and it is supposed that
at that spot the earth must have opened and closed
over them again. The Archbishop barely escaped
with his life by jumping out of a window as the
floors of his palace were giving way beneath him,
and more than nine-tenths of the clergy perished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
We preserve in our family a manuscript which
gives an accurate account of this terrible catastrophe;
as a youngster, I was often made to copy
it out, and I therefore know it almost off by
heart. It tells how the morning of the 6th of
April, 1667, broke calm and bright, and that the
atmosphere was still and serene, without anything
to indicate the approaching danger, when suddenly,
without any premonitory sound, about two hours
after sunrise, while most of the inhabitants were
still in their houses, or in the churches hearing
early mass, the earth shook so violently that in a
few minutes the whole town was in ruins, with the
exception of the fortress, and a few other buildings,
the walls of which were enormously thick. In
addition to the destruction caused by falling houses,
large rocks came toppling down, detached from the
mountain, which, as you see, apparently overhangs
the city. This added greatly to the terror and
devastation. So far as we know there was but
<i>one shock</i>, and it lasted only a few seconds; but no
where and at no time was so much damage done thus
instantaneously.
</p>

<p>
"Many harrowing scenes were recounted, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
perhaps the most terrible of all was that of a school
of boys which was swallowed up beneath the ruins.
All the unfortunate lads perished, most of them
by a miserable lingering death, and for days their
moans and cries for help and water could be heard
by their distracted friends, without the possibility
of giving them any relief. One would have
thought this a sufficient visitation for poor Ragusa,
but calamities never come singly. A fire broke out
on the same day, and towards evening a strong
wind arose and fanned the flames, thus increasing
the conflagration beyond the power of control.
Night came on, and the whole side of the mountains
was illuminated by the flames of the burning city.
Then the wild mountaineers, the Morlacchi, came
down in swarms to pilfer and snatch whatever they
could from the universal wreck. The scenes then
enacted defied all powers of description. The fires
were burning with exceptional brightness and fury,
in consequence of the conflagration having reached
the stores of oil, tallow and tar accumulated in
the Arsenal and elsewhere. Groups of Morlacchi,
undeterred by the crumbling walls and the scorching
rafters, could be seen flitting about among ruins
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
regardless of the danger! Occasionally some such
group having ventured too far, would disappear
with a fearful scream into some yawning gulf;
while in another spot two parties of the same
plunderers might be seen in deadly conflict, fighting
with their long straight knives over their unlawful
booty. It was a fearful night.
</p>

<p>
"But all this is ancient history; there is another
tragic episode connected with Lachroma. Another
calamity is brought to our minds when we look
upon its shores. Poor Prince Maximilian!—alas!
alas! he was a good and kind man,—and that noble
unfortunate Princess Charlotte! I had the honour
of being in their company more than once, both in
Europe and Mexico; they were so good, so affable,
so happy, till in an evil hour they allowed
themselves to be led away by ambition. The Prince
seemed all along to have had a presentiment of evil.
I was told by one who was present, that
nothing could be more melancholy than his
departure from Miramar, and the leave-taking
when he was waited on by a deputation from Trieste
was the most painful scene he ever witnessed. The
Prince was completely overcome, and fairly broke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
down on this occasion. After his assassination
the island was sold, and now I hear it is for sale
again."
</p>

<p>
The good old Monk was silent for a few minutes,
and then gently putting his hand on my shoulder,
he said,
</p>

<p>
"You are English, <i><span lang="it_IT">non è vero</span></i>? You are not
American? I would not say a hurtful word to
mortal, but I cannot help thinking that the President
of the United States was nearly as much to
blame as the Mexican savage for the murder of
Maximilian; one word from the United States'
President would have saved the Emperor's
life."
</p>

<p>
"But what about the French Emperor?" I
asked; "he who got the poor Prince into the
scrape, and then left him to get out of it as best
he could?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah; true—true," repeated the Monk. "<i><span lang="it_IT">e quell'altro
birbaccione di Bazaine</span></i>! Ah! Providence will
overtake them all. But look, see how beautiful
Ragusa is, how picturesque! Although I am only
a poor Capuchin monk, I feel proud of my native
city—<i><span lang="it_IT">che mi son Raguséo</span></i>!" he exclaimed, breaking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
out into his native Venetian dialect. "Though
most of my life has been spent far away in foreign
missions, I still cling with fondness to my native
shores, and feel thankful, most thankful," he
repeated, bending his head, "that it has pleased His
Holiness and our General to order me back here
again at last."

<p class="drop-cap">
I FELT an unusual degree of regret,
thinking I should so soon lose the
company of Padre Anselmo; we had
come all the way together from Trieste,
and had spent many pleasant hours in genial conversation,
flavoured from time to time with spicy,
sharp, but good-humoured polemics, during which
the Padre never lost his temper, and I had not
always the best of the argument.
</p>

<p>
He was a very remarkable man, of an ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
noble Ragusan family, evidently pious, yet wonderfully
large-minded. I shall always remember with
pleasure the conversations we had together on the
deck of the 'San Carlo,' by the bright Italian moonlight,
on those deep, smooth waters of the Adriatic
that sparkled with phosphorescence at every stroke of
the paddle-wheel. He was aware I was a Protestant,
and though he had been a missionary for many
years he knew how to avoid polemics whenever
it was fit. He had been in South America and
in North America; in the plains of the Amazon
and the Orinoco, and among the Sierras of
Mexico.
</p>

<p>
I asked him about his success among the Indians,
and after reflecting for a little he gave me a most
interesting account of his life's labours among
them. I carefully noted down each night in my
diary, after we had parted, the principal headings
of his narrative, and some day I may give to the
public an account of the labours, trials, and sufferings
of this good and conscientious monk.
</p>

<p>
In answer to my question as to the amount of
success he had obtained during his long intercourse
with American Indians, he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"There is a most extraordinary difference in
intelligence between the different tribes, even among
those living close together; some are wonderfully
more intelligent than others, and, strange to say,
I found them better the farther they were removed
from the influence of civilization. A great deal
might be made of them were it not for the evil
influence of the traders who come among them—the
most pernicious of whom I invariably found
were those coming from the United States. These
traders, pioneers of civilization—as they called
themselves—were almost invariably men without
any religion or principle; awful blasphemers, their
oaths were too terrific! They generally consisted
of the veriest scum and offscourings of commercial
cities; they showed the poor savages the very worst
examples, for fair trading was unknown to them,
and lying, overreaching, and brow-beating were
their chief characteristics, while of drunkenness and
unblushing debauchery they were terrible examples.
I was once asked by a chief why we came so
far to teach them, and left our own people untaught."
</p>

<p>
Padre Anselmo also told me that some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
natives had some idea of the Divinity, and
were very teachable, not like the Negroes of
the West Coast of Africa among whom he had
laboured a short time. He contrasted the capabilities
of both races, and shaking his head,
added,
</p>

<p>
"I fear it will take hundreds of centuries of incessant
teaching, and that more by example than by
word of mouth, before any good will come from
missions among the Negroes; they seem utterly
incapable of understanding any of the attributes of
God. They look upon him invariably as one to
be feared, and propitiated by gifts and sacrifices,
so that he may be induced, if possible, to do them
no harm."
</p>

<p>
A chief came to him one night by stealth, "but
not like Nicodemus," as the worthy Monk added;
he brought various presents to the mission, some
of considerable value, consisting of native rings of
twisted gold. He whispered under his breath to
the Monk,
</p>

<p>
"You white man know everything, and you say
your God rules everything. Tell me where I can
find him, that I may kill him! he is a bad god—he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
has killed my favourite wife, and now I must
kill him!"
</p>

<p>
The Negro was foaming at the mouth from
impotent rage, and his fearful language, together
with the rolling of his eyes and the contortions
of his body, impressed the Monk at first with the
idea that he was an impersonation of the Evil One.
Yet this chief had till then been the most promising
of all those natives on whom he had been wasting
his time, his patience, and his doctrine. In vain
the Missionary tried to reason with the demoniac
chief; his words made no impression, and the
savage, failing to discover from the Monk the whereabouts
of the white man's God, returned to his
village, where he burned his own national fetish,
and then cut off the heads of half-a-dozen
wretches, having first charged them with messages
to be delivered to his wife in dead-man's-land!
</p>

<p>
One evening Padre Anselmo and I, after
making ourselves snug on a pile of sacks near
the binnacle, were talking about missionary
work, when he spoke to me about our Protestant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
missions, and asked me many questions
concerning them.
</p>

<p>
"You work your missions differently from the
way we do ours; you pay your missionaries well,
and even allow them, I have been told, to trade
at times, and to buy and sell and follow different
callings. I have also heard that you send missionaries
abroad without any particular regard to
their capabilities, for instance as to their knowledge
of the language of the country they are sent to.
Now all our missionaries are strictly prepared
for the country where they are intended to labour,
and are not sent out until they have acquired
a good knowledge of the language of that country.
How do you find your system to work? Have
you had much success in the East Indies during
the hundred years you have had the opportunity of
working in them?"
</p>

<p>
I imagined I could detect something of a smile
playing about the corners of his mouth as he made
these remarks, and just as I was about to reply,
a scene came to my mind of which I had read or
heard an account somewhere, of an English
missionary addressing an Arab audience in Tangier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
through the medium of a Gibraltar Jew, for the
missionary was utterly innocent of any language
but his own London English, and my innate
appreciation of the ridiculous so overcame my
sense of what was proper and decorous that I
laughed myself nearly into fits.<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> However,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
having recovered my equanimity, I replied, "I
did not know very much about the matter; but
I had always heard that, generally speaking, the
native Christians were the greatest blackguards
in India, the least objectionable being certainly
the Goanese Catholics," at which the good old monk
seemed highly pleased.
</p>

<p>
His ideas of missionary work were peculiar and
interesting. "We should always," he said, "treat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
savages and the utterly uneducated, whether at
home or abroad, who are scarcely better than
savages, like little children, like very little children
in intelligence, yet endowed with the passions and
vices of grown up men. One should therefore,
if possible, never try to teach them things beyond
their understanding, but make their practical
civilization proceed <i><span lang="la">pari passu</span></i> with their religious
training—instilling morality before preaching
doctrine and dogma, both teachings being backed
up by unexceptionable example. "These are not
my own ideas," added Padre Anselmo, "they are
the precepts of the wonderful man who preceded
me in the Amazon Mission, the present Pontiff,
His Holiness Pope Pius IX., whose equal will never
again occupy the chair of St. Peter."
</p>

<p>
"What! was the Pope ever a missionary?" I
asked with astonishment. I knew he had been a
soldier, and had been even assured that in his early
days he was initiated a Freemason in a Lodge
in Sicily; there was nothing very extraordinary
in his having been a missionary, but I had never
heard of it before, and was therefore taken by
surprise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Indeed he was," replied Padre Anselmo,
"and a very zealous and hard-working missionary,
whose memory is reverenced to this day,
among many a wild tribe on the banks of the
Amazon."
</p>

<p>
Then we began to talk politics, that is to say I
talked, the Monk only listened, till musingly I said,
"I wonder who will succeed him in the Chair of
St. Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"Whoever he may be," replied the Monk,
"he will have a difficult task coming after such
a man."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been lately at Rome?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"I was there two months ago," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"What then do you think of Cardinal P—?
do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
The Monk fixed his eyes on me for a moment,
as if he would have read my most inmost thoughts,
and then speaking very slowly, said:
</p>

<p>
"That Sicilian Monk has long been aiming at
the Tiara; he lives within himself, has no confidant,
no intimate friend, has no talents, only plenty
of doggedness, <i><span lang="it_IT">vorrebbe Papeggiare</span></i>, but no,
never will he occupy the Pontifical chair, never!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
and the Monk, for a minute looked me full in the
face.
</p>

<p>
We were now getting quite close to the town,
which is built on the narrow strip of land that
lies between the Adriatic and the Dalmatian
mountains, that here rise up almost perpendicularly
behind it. The morning mists were
clearing off, and the hazy outlines of the towers
and ramparts, the cupolas and steeples, together
with the bright colouring of the sails of the
felucas and trabaccoli gliding out of the harbour,
threading their way through the many islands
scattered outside it, formed a picture that might be
realized by a painter but of which I will not
attempt the description.
</p>

<p>
We were now fairly in the port of Gravosa, and
the steamer was surrounded by native boats conveying
eager candidates for the privilege of carrying ourselves
and luggage to the shore. The real port is
at Ragusa itself, sheltered and protected by the
ancient bastions and towers of the city, but, though
amply deep enough for its ancient galleys, and for
those argosies (so named after this very city of
Ragusa) which in ancient times monopolized with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
Venice the commerce of the world, it is not now
large enough or deep enough to accommodate our
modern practical, though inelegant fire-ships. It
has consequently been abandoned for the port of
Gravosa, which is not only large, safe, and
commodious, but also exquisitely beautiful, though
inconveniently distant, being nearly a mile from
the city. An excellent road, however, originally
made by the French and subsequently improved by
the Austrians, communicates between the two
places, and numerous small carriages drawn by
one or two horses are constantly in readiness to
convey for a trifle those who do not wish to walk
to Ragusa.
</p>

<p>
The two monks and I were soon on shore,
and there I reluctantly parted with them; they
went on foot towards their convent, while I
took a small one-horse carriage and started off to
the city.
</p>

<p>
Away we went at full gallop skirting the
harbour, till the rising ground at the end of the
little valley compelled our lively little horse to a
slower rate of progression. We soon however
topped the hill, when we again came in view of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
the sea on our right hand, while on our left were
numbers of villas peeping out through masses of
oleanders and gigantic aloes, whose flower stems,
like colossal candelabra, fifteen to twenty feet
in height, gave a peculiarly exotic character to the
scene. Many of these villas were in ruins, and
others more or less damaged, still bearing evidence
of the French occupation at the beginning of this
century, and of their expulsion by the Russian and
Montenegrin troops.
</p>

<p>
Ragusa was now fairly again in sight, and a noble
city it is, and how picturesque! so far as its greatness
is concerned, Ragusa is now but the shadow
of what it was in bygone days. Its political importance
has faded away—its commercial supremacy is
a thing of the past; but its local beauty, its domes,
its campaniles, its lofty cut-stone palaces, its
churches and public buildings, its exquisitely clean
streets, its balmy air, its azure sea and its pleasant
society—all these are things real and of the present.
But Ragusa is not a place to be described, it must
be seen and studied to be appreciated. See it from
the land, or from the sea—wander through its
narrow, quaint, artistic streets, ramble round its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
walls and ramparts, and you will find it from every
point of view a most remarkable place.
</p>

<p>
This grand old city, into which neither horse
nor carriage is ever allowed to enter, was founded
about the beginning of the seventh century, not
very long after the foundation of Venice. Both
cities were Republics, rivals in commerce and
in the arts, and their people were incessantly at
war with one another. But though Venice, by
degrees, was able to subdue and include in her grasp
almost the entire Eastern coast of the Adriatic, she
never succeeded, either by cajolery or brute force,
in conquering the Ragusans, who maintained their
freedom till 1806; when, after existing as an independent
State for upwards of a thousand years,
during which time it had remained as an advanced
post of European civilization on the borders of
wild Bosnia and fierce Albania, it fell with Venice,
Genoa, and the other free communities of Europe
which Napoleon I. wiped off the map of the
world.
</p>

<p>
All down the coast of the Adriatic may be seen
the winged Lion of St. Mark, wherever the encroaching
ambition of the Venetians enabled them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
to establish themselves; but in Ragusa you will
seek that grim Venetian effigy in vain. Ragusa
never was conquered by her great rival!
</p>

<p>
The carrettella came spinning, at the rate of a
hunt, down the hill, at the bottom of which is the
entrance to Ragusa, and turning sharp round at
a speed that threatened to upset us bag and baggage
into the middle of the road, pulled up suddenly
on the right, where a very primitive hotel offers
the only prospect of refreshment to the chance traveller
in those parts; though, for such as intend
remaining some little time, good accommodation
can be obtained within the city. The hotel is most
picturesquely situated on the very edge of the sea,
opposite to the fortifications "<i>di mare</i>," and has in
front a considerable plantation of beautiful Paolonias,
then in full blossom; on the opposite side
is the café, where of a Summer's evening congregate
the rank and fashion of Ragusa to enjoy their
ices and lemonade, and listen to the excellent band
of the Austrian regiment quartered there, and whatever
gossip, scandalous or otherwise, that may be
buzzing about. And very enjoyable it must be!
fine climate, pleasant society, lovely scenery, easy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
access to the rest of Europe, either East or West,
and cheap living—what more could be desired?
I would not ask for more.

IT has always been a source of much
astonishment to me, seeing the facility
with which these parts can be reached
from Trieste, that so few of the
ubiquitous English—indeed, I might say none of
them,—ever visit them, or any of the other many
beautiful and interesting localities which crowd the
Eastern shores of the Adriatic. I really believe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
those countries are not visited because they are
in a certain sense unknown. I trust, however, that
some of my readers who may perchance be tired
of those hackneyed tours which, year after year,
are undertaken by the travelling multitudes, will
try a venture some day in Dalmatia.
</p>

<p>
Starting from Trieste in one of the many coasting
steamers which trade to Corfu, stopping at every
place on the Eastern shores of the Adriatic from
Capo d'Istria downwards, and making excursions
from each into the interior, anyone fond of everything
beautiful and picturesque, whether in nature
or in art, would have the most delightful trip
imaginable; and if getting out at Cattaro he will
scale those wonderful mountains which seem ever
on the point of toppling over on that devoted city,
and penetrate into Montenegro, coming back to the
Adriatic by the Lake of Scutari (or Skodra as it
<i>ought</i> to be called) in Northern Albania, he will
have made an excursion in the heart of Europe,
within seven days from London, and in the short
space of five weeks, which for beauty of country,
wildness of scenery, novelty of life, and magnificence
of native costumes cannot be equalled from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
Spain to the Caucasus, or from Norway to the
Lebanon!
</p>

<p>
Having made my adieux to Mr. Paton, our Consul
at Ragusa, to whom as well as to Persich Effendi,
the Ottoman Consul, I was largely indebted for
much kind advice, as well as for a personal introduction
to Mr. Yonin, Russian Consul at Ragusa,
who subsequently at Cattaro and at Cettigne proved
a kind friend and most valuable and charming
companion, I returned on board and was soon
steering south again. We steamed quite close
inland, and had an excellent view of the ancient
fortifications of Ragusa and its old harbour,
only frequented at present by the felucas and
trabaccoli which carry on the coasting trade of the
country.
</p>

<p>
We also passed close to the island of Lachroma.
The Russian Consul, Mr. Yonin, told me it was
for sale and would probably go cheap. I can't
conceive a spot on earth where a man tired of the
bustle of life and the feverish excitement and turmoil
of cities could more delightfully spend the
remainder of his days. There is a fairly good
house on the island, which is itself beautifully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
wooded and laid-out. It is sufficiently near to
Ragusa to enable one to obtain everything one
could require from that city, it is right in the
gangway of all the steamers going up and down
the Adriatic, within five days of London, and
with such a number of communications with the
outer world that it would be seclusion only as long
as one wished it to be so.
</p>

<p>
As to the climate, none more beautiful could
be desired—sufficiently warm to grow figs, grapes,
and oranges, yet daily tempered in Summer by
the delicious sea-breeze of the Adriatic, which
prevents the heat from ever being oppressive, while
of Winter there is barely the name—the thermometer
seldom going down to frost.
</p>

<p>
The sea teems with fish of the most delicious
kinds, some of which are totally unknown among
us; the dentale coronato, for instance, the true
sardine, and the rosy mullet, the woodcock of the
sea, which here grows to an immense size—while
from the mainland one can always obtain at
wonderfully low prices abundance of small mountain
mutton, poultry, and game.
</p>

<p>
I never was in any place that took my fancy like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
Ragusa and Lachroma—so lovely, so picturesque,
so secluded, and yet so accessible!
</p>

<p>
Since my return to England I have heard with
deep regret of the loss we have sustained by the
death of A. A. Paton, Esq., our Consul-General at
Ragusa. The country has to regret in him an able
and industrious servant, while literature has to
mourn for one of its most gifted votaries, as his
works on Egypt, Servia, and the Adriatic will
amply attest; but only those who had the pleasure
of his acquaintance can at all venture to measure
the loss which his death must be in his own family
circle!
</p>

<p>
Now the bell rings, and Giovanni bustles up
and down the deck, intimating, "<i><span lang="it_IT">che'l pranzo ze
pronto</span></i>," so down we all plunged into the saloon,
where a good dinner, as usual, welcomed us.
</p>

<p>
As the coast is uninteresting, besides which
I don't want to go on deck at present, I may as
well tell you of what our Italian dinner consisted.
We first had an excellent Julienne soup, with
abundance of grated Parmesan for such as appreciated
it; next was served the "<i><span lang="it_IT">fritto</span></i>," according
to old Italian custom, which always enumerates the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
following dishes, to succeed each other in an
orthodox dinner:—<span lang="it_IT">minestra, fritto, lesso, umido,
arrosto, dolce, frutta</span>, and, when in season, slices
of melon, or fresh figs, served up immediately after
the soup, to be eaten with thin slices of raw ham
or Bologna sausage. Figs being in season they
were not wanting, so conforming to the usage of
the country I ate some with raw Bologna sausage,
and learnt fully to appreciate the strange compound,
which I afterwards always indulged in whenever I
had a chance.
</p>

<p>
The <i><span lang="it_IT">fritto</span></i> was delicious (assuredly nowhere else
can they fry as in Italy); it consisted of <span lang="it_IT">zucchettine</span>
and <span lang="it_IT">fiori</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, young unexpanded gourd flowers
and very young gourds not bigger thin an egg,
cut in thin slices, dipped in the thinnest of batter
and fried quite crisp and golden brown, and served
dry without a particle of grease. Then came a dish
of <i><span lang="it_IT">gnocchi alla Milanese</span></i>, a superb dish, but difficult
to explain; imagine the ingredients of a colossal
<i><span lang="fr_FR">vol-au-vent à la financière</span></i>, replete with livers, cocks'
combs, unborn eggs, &amp;c., &amp;c., surrounded by a
bastion of a peculiar preparation, made of maize-flour,
and the whole bathed in tomato sauce and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
sprinkled right over with grated Parmesan, "<i><span lang="it_IT">proprio
da far riavere i morti</span></i>," as the <i>chef</i> exclaimed to me
after dinner, when, handing him a cigar, I complimented
him on his <i><span lang="it_IT">gnocchi</span></i>. Then came the <i><span lang="it_IT">arrosto</span></i>
which consisted of veal and fowls, and after
that a splendid <i><span lang="it_IT">piatto dolce</span></i> of stewed peaches
in an artistic cage of caramel sugar, ornamented
with strange devices of most delicious marzapane.
</p>

<p>
Having slowly worked our way through this
sumptuous repast, we went on deck, where coffee
was served with its usual accompaniment of
Maraschino, both sweetened and unsweetened,
together with the inevitable smoke, which contrary
to reason, as one would think, is even more
comforting in hot countries like the Levant,
than it is in cold damp regions like Holland.
</p>

<p>
I have a dim recollection of the captain tapping
me on the shoulder and telling me something about
Ragusa Vecchia and Epidaurus as we were
steaming down the coast; but I was in too dreamy
a state to pay much attention to him at the time,
and as I knew the coast was uninteresting, I told
him to call me as soon as we should come in sight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
of the Bocche and Castelnuovo, and dozed away
again.
</p>

<p>
I afterwards learnt that this Epidaurus, about
which I was rather fretting for having refused to
stir from my siesta to look at it, was really not
worth seeing, though an ancient city, having been
founded by a Greek colony somewhere about 700
years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, more or less; but all its antiquities had
been removed long ago.
</p>

<p>
It was between three and four in the afternoon
when I awoke of my own accord, thus anticipating
the captain, who was just coming to tell me that
we were about entering the canal of Cattaro, as it
is called, but which to our ear is far better
described by the name of Fjord of Cattaro. It
is to all intents and purposes a Fjord, being an
arm of the sea running up for eighteen miles into
land, between high precipitous cliffs; and if there
is not a glacier at the end of it, but only a quaint
Dalmatian town with the most picturesque fort and
fortifications in the world, it does not alter the
character of the inlet.
</p>

<p>
The entrance to this Fjord, called "le Bocche di
Cattaro," is guarded on the right by the Fort of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
Castelnuovo, and on the left is bounded by a narrow
strip of Turkish territory, a portion of Herzegovina,
which here comes down to the Adriatic, separating
the Circolo of Ragusa from that of Cattaro. By
some strange political arrangement, or oversight
more probably, another narrow strip of Turkish
territory comes down to the Adriatic on the
north of Ragusa, completely isolating that ancient
Republic which finds itself thus entirely surrounded
by Ottoman territory on three sides, while on the
fourth it is bounded by the Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
The country about the entrance of the Bocche di
Cattaro is fine, well wooded and planted with olive
trees, through which can be seen numerous habitations,
while many of the rugged heights are crowned
with semi-fortified churches, which served as places
of refuge to the women and children in troublous
times.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding onwards, the scene varies and the
trees lessen in numbers, though the landscape
loses nothing of its beauty, as by the constant
windings of the Fjord the changes are continuous
and rapid, and the many villages built on the
edge of the water, and sharply reflected in it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
add one more charm to the picture. At one point
the Fjord is barely half a mile across, when suddenly
it expands into a lake of many miles in circumference,
where all the navies of the world could lie
in safety. But now the scene changes again and
the Fjord becomes a narrow tortuous channel,
bounded on either side by naked rocky cliffs. Like
the rest of the coast of Dalmatia it is, however,
very beautiful. About half way between Castelnuovo
and Cattaro, the Fjord expands and divides
right and left forming two bays, that of Risano
to the left, and that of Cattaro to the right;
while in front rise the almost perpendicular crags of
Montenegro, at the foot of which, with barely
room to build on, so near does the mountain
come to the edge of the water, stands the town
of Perasto with the ancient fort of Santa Croce just
above it.
</p>

<p>
This place must have been of considerable
importance within late years, still I never saw such
a picture of poverty and desolation. The houses
are not in ruins, but look dilapidated; the windows
are broken in, the jalousies hanging by one hinge
and in pieces, while in many places the roofs are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
stripped of their tiles. The position of Perasto
cannot be surpassed; built on a promontory
facing the west, it has the lake-like expansion
of the Gulf of Cattaro in front and does not
consequently labour under the disadvantage Cattaro
suffers from, by having a chain of mountains in
front of it to the westward, which deprive it of
the sun in Winter before two o'clock in the afternoon.
The style of the houses in Perasto shows
that not long ago it could boast of an opulent
population, which is further exemplified by the
fortress built at the expense of the town—by its
lofty steeple and by its churches. One in particular
caught my eye from the steamer, <i>it had no façade</i>,
not that it had fallen into ruin, neither had it been
shaken down by an earthquake, but was built so;
open to the weather with a half cupola something
like one of those little roadside shrines dedicated
to the Virgin which we meet with constantly in
Italy and other Catholic countries, only on a very
much larger scale.
</p>

<p>
I felt quite interested in Perasto, it looked so
picturesque, so noble, so poor! One house
especially struck my fancy, but the word house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
does not convey its appearance, it was what an
Italian would call a palazzo. The entrance was
evidently from a back street, while the side which
faced the water consisted of a <i>loggia</i> of many
pilasters and arches, into which opened the rooms
of the ground floor, while above it were tiers
of large and handsome windows. In front of the
<i>loggia</i> was a paved terrace, from which a series
of steps, the whole length of the house, led down
to the water. It was uninhabited and in fact
going rapidly to ruin! I fancied to myself what
a little paradise one could make of it; I saw in
my mind's eye a row of orange trees growing on
that terrace, a yacht moored close into those
steps, and life and bustle in those chambers
where all was now silence and decay. What can
have brought such desolation on Perasto? I
asked several people but I could get no satisfactory
answer! some blamed Austria, some <i><span lang="it_IT">il commercio</span></i>;
I suppose I could have bought the fee simple of that
house in Perasto for a £10 note.
</p>

<p>
In front of Perasto are two small islands—San
Giorgio and La Madonna. In the church of
La Madonna is to be seen an ancient picture
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
of the Virgin, attributed as usual to the artistic
efforts of the Evangelist Luke, who evidently,
from what I have seen of his works of art in
different places, was not possessed of much talent
in that line. Tradition states that the picture was
transported in 1452, by an unknown hand, from
Negropont to this rock; and being seen amidst
lighted candles by some fishermen, it was removed
to the church of Perasto. The next night it
returned to the island; and the same action having
been repeated three times, it was presumed that the
picture preferred remaining there; thus they built
a church for it, which no doubt turned out a profitable
speculation.

TURNING our backs now on that
branch of the Fjord which leads to
Risano, we steamed due south in
the direction of Cattaro. Nothing
could exceed the wild grandeur of this portion of
the Gulf. The right hand shore was now entirely
in the shade, while the crags on the left being
exposed to the full glare of the afternoon sun
showed a play of colours too beautiful to describe.
Had these cliffs been clothed with varied foliage
interspersed with the rocks, they would have
formed a picture unequalled in any other place on
the globe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was six o'clock when we moored alongside the
quay of Cattaro, one of the most picturesque cities
of the whole Adriatic, so I had plenty of time to
walk about and see the place as well as to make
arrangements for my advance into Montenegro
on the following day, as I was anxious to proceed
at once to Cettigne, in order to be present at the
festival of St. Peter, during which a fair is held,
to which congregate thousands, not only from Montenegro,
but from all the surrounding countries.
Thanks, however, to Persich Effendi, the Ottoman
Consul at Ragusa, to whom I had brought an
introduction from the Ottoman Ambassador at
Vienna, I found everything already prepared for
my trip. The agent of the Austrian Lloyd at
Cattaro, Signor Jackschich to whom I can never
feel too much obliged, had already procured for
me a guide and two horses, thus saving me all
trouble, and allowing so much more time to look
about me at Cattaro. As soon as we had obtained
<i><span lang="fr_FR">pratique</span></i>, the formality of which we carried out
regularly at every place we touched, though, in
reality, it was a farce, Signor Jackschich came on
board, and having introduced himself and told me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
what he had arranged, placed himself at my
disposal for the rest of the evening. We at
once went on shore, and traversing the Mall,
which lies between the quays and the walls of
the city, and which serves as the promenade of
the <i>Bocchesi</i>, we passed through the principal gate
of Cattaro, and entered the precincts of the fortifications.
</p>

<p>
Here, as in most other cities in Dalmatia, no
horse, or vehicle of any kind (except sedan chairs)
is allowed to enter. The streets in consequence are
beautifully clean, and the piazza, which is paved
in squares of alternate coloured marble, is more
like the floor of the hall of an Italian palace than
anything else. The streets are narrow, as might
have been surmised, but there are some very fine
old houses, some exquisite bits of art hidden
away in nooks and corners which one would have
loved to sketch had there been time, half built up
porticoes with oleanders peeping over them, and
bits of lovely hammered iron work of the Renaissance
period. But I had no time, so after making
a rapid tour through the little city, we came out
on the promenade, as I was anxious to have another
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
view of Cattaro, from the outside, before it
became too dark.
</p>

<p>
My friend Paton does not render half justice to
this city in his charming book, "The Highlands
and Islands of the Adriatic;" but he is so in love
with Ragusa—and, if truth must be told, so am I—that
he has nothing to say for Cattaro; it is
true he saw it in Winter, when it must be a dismal
place. But Cattaro, for all that, deserves a visit,
and anyone fond of sketching will spend, with
profit, several days in and about the place. It is
situated at the extreme end of the Fjord of that
name, on a very narrow ledge of land at the foot
of the most precipitous cliffs facing the west,
up which it extends for a short space. It
is surrounded by the ancient Venetian walls, bastions
and fortifications, and crowned by a fort
perched on the very summit of the rock, a thousand
feet above the city. Looking at it from
below, it seems scarcely balanced on the cliff, and
one expects to see it come tumbling down every
moment.
</p>

<p>
The fortifications of the town are connected by
crenelated walls with the fort itself on two sides,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
thus inclosing a considerable space on the face of
the mountain, something in the shape of a triangle,
of which the town would form the base, and the
fort the apex, which is still garrisoned, and many
a harmless rusty old cannon can be seen peeping
through the embrasures. Having returned from
the opposite side of the water, where I had gone
the better to see the fortifications, we took a walk
up and down the esplanade between the water and
the walls, to look at the <i>beau monde</i> on their boulevard,
and then adjourned to the café on the same
esplanade to have some ices <i>al fresco</i>, and make
our final arrangements for the following morning.
</p>

<p>
The public walk at Cattaro is very well laid
out, and the most is made of the very contracted
space at command. Two rows of large trees extend
along the walls on each side of the gate, above
which is to be seen, as usual, the Lion of St. Mark.
Not so natural, perhaps, as Edwin Landseer's animals
at the foot of Nelson's column; but, certainly,
a more dignified beast than the one with straight
tail which until lately kept watch and ward over
Trafalgar Square from the top of Northumberland
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
House. At the northern end of the Mall is the
café, and round about it the grounds are laid out
in gardens, where, under the shade of gigantic
oleanders and mulberry trees, little round tables,
made of enormously thick slabs, resting on short
central pillars, for all the world like Brobdingnagian
mushrooms, are laid out and surrounded with
stools for the accommodation of all comers. The
stone of which these round tables are made is
powerfully sonorous, and if lightly struck, even
with one's knuckles, gives out a beautiful soft
tone. If cut into lengths and properly poised,
excellent rock harmoniums could be made of
it.
</p>

<p>
Here I fell in again with the Russian Consul,
who introduced me to one of the finest specimens
of men I ever saw, a Montenegrin chief, by name
Pero Pejovich, commandant of the Grahovo (pronounced
Graho), who had come from Risano in a
boat, and was bound for Montenegro to be present
at the Feast. He was dressed in full gala
Montenegrin costume, <i>plus</i> the Risano jacket of
crimson cloth without sleeves, thickly embroidered
with gold, and on it the medals and decorations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
he had gained in battle. At another table were
seated, also in full costume, two Montenegrin ladies
of a family who had been exiled for political causes,
and who were waiting at Cattaro in hopes of
obtaining an amnesty which would permit them
to return to their homes.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set, and the short twilight had
nearly merged into darkness; the great heat of the
day was now tempered by a delicious balmy feeling,
as the cooler air from the mountains came
down to mingle with that of the lower strata; the
musical hum of the many voices, the exquisite
Trebigne tobacco in our cigarettes, the delicious
coffee, all conspired to make that evening one of
the most delightful I ever passed. I got another
chair, and stretched my legs on it; the natives
stared—no Oriental ever thinks of stretching his
legs—the acme of comfort for him is to tuck them
under him. I felt supremely happy, and expressed
myself so.
</p>

<p>
"I could live here for ever," I said to Signor
Jackschich.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," rejoined Pero Pejovich, "but wait till
it rains, and you will soon wish to run away from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
Cattaro. I have known it rain here for six weeks
without stopping for a moment."
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, the band of the Austrian regiment
quartered here came on the scene, with the
same lamp arrangement I had seen at Pola, and
for upwards of an hour played the most delicious
music to our intense delight. The Consul
now reminded me that we should have to start
betimes the following morning, if we wanted
to avoid being roasted in the middle of the day
on the rocks of Montenegro. But the sense of
enjoyment was too great, and I could not bear to
break the spell of the hour which I was enjoying
to the fullest. That I should have an excuse for delaying
a little longer, I began to talk in Italian to a
little beggar boy who had quietly been asking me
for something the whole evening, not with noisy
importunate appeals, but by the eloquent look
of about the finest pair of eyes that ever were
seen.
</p>

<p>
"Don't take any notice of the young ruffian,"
said Signor Jackschich, "he is the plague of the
town, and the worry of his father. He won't
work, and he is in every mischief that is going."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But I don't tell lies—neither do I steal," retorted
the bold young brat, who could be no
more than eight or nine. "It is too hot to work,
and as to going home to sleep <i><span lang="it_IT">la dentro</span></i>," he
said, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb
to the town, "when I can enjoy the cool nights
under these trees <i><span lang="it_IT">al fresco</span></i>, I would rather not!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke excellent Italian, and his manner was
dignified and self possessed.

<p>
"<i><span lang="fr_FR">Diable</span>!</i>" said Yonin, "<i><span lang="fr_FR">nous avons ici un philosophe</span>!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Can you speak German or French, little chap?"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied in Italian, "<i><span lang="it_IT">non parlo che Illirico
ed Italiano</span></i>."
</p>

<p>
I gave him coins to the amount of about a franc;
but when he saw so much money in the palm of
his hand—an amount which, to his eyes, seemed
perfectly fabulous—his first impulse was to hold
it out to me again, thinking I was joking with
him; but when I assured him it was <i><span lang="it_IT">veramente tutto
per lui</span></i>, he cut three capers in the air, and rushed
away to where some other children were, to show
his treasures and recount his good fortune. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
all the subjects of the Emperor of Austria, in all
his vast dominions, I venture to say that the
happiest on that night was that little beggar brat
in the secluded little city of Cattaro at the far
end of his empire in the extreme point of Dalmatia.

<p class="drop-cap">
AT the earliest peep of day on the
morning of the 9th of July, I arose
from the deck of the steamer on
which I had slept for so many pleasant
nights, notwithstanding its hardness. Thanks
to the kind attention of Giovanni, the steward, a
cup of hot and tolerably good coffee was not
wanting to fortify me against the effects of the
morning air. He wanted me to add a small glass
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
of maraschino unsweetened "<i><span lang="it_IT">per scacciar l'aria
cattiva</span></i>," as he said in his Venetian dialect, but not
being addicted to <i>pegs</i>, I contented myself with the
coffee and a few biscuits.
</p>

<p>
The faintest tinge of rose showing in the East
over the rocks which hang over Cattaro, seeming
ever to threaten it with instant ruin, barely enabled
me at first to distinguish objects on the mole
alongside of which our steamer was moored; but
as the light increased I could make out, under the
shadow of the trees which form the boulevard and
public promenade of the Bocchesi, the stalwart
figures of a dozen Montenegrins who had come
down from Cettigne to accompany the Russian
Consul on his way to the festival of St. Peter, and
the court of the illustrious Prince who now so
wisely rules those splendid mountain tribes.
</p>

<p>
Modestly drawn up on one side of them I could
see my own portion of the caravan, consisting of
only two horses, one to carry myself, the other to
carry my luggage, all under the direction of the
excellent guide provided for me the day before by
the kindness of Signor Jackschich.
</p>

<p>
Everything was now ready and myself in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
saddle, when the Russian Consul made his appearance,
and we finally started just as the dawn
was quickening into day.
</p>

<p>
Skirting by the bastions which defend Cattaro
on the sea side, we crossed the bridge that spans
the little mountain torrent which here empties itself
into the sea, and turning sharply to the right we
passed through the open market-place where the
Montenegrins come down to sell their farm-produce
to the Bocchesi; but who, owing to the somewhat
evil name they have unfairly acquired, are never
allowed to penetrate into the city unless they first
deliver up their arms at the military post outside,
just as we do at Aden with the Arabs of the surrounding
districts.
</p>

<p>
Having crossed the market-place, we reached in
a few minutes the base of the rocks, and at once
commenced ascending that wonderful road zig-zagged
across the face of the mountain, and known
by the name of "<i>Le scale di Cattaro</i>." Here we
joined an additional party, also journeying to
Cettigne for the festival of St. Peter, and among
them was conspicuous the handsome Montenegrin
Chieftain, Pero Pejovich, commandant of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
Grahovo, whose pleasant acquaintance we had made
the evening before under the mulberry trees of
Cattaro.
</p>

<p>
There was also in the same group a monk, a
most picturesque looking individual, but certainly
most unclerical-looking. He was dressed in a
costume very much resembling the Montenegrin
fashion, only of sombre colours, and had his jerkin
trimmed with furs instead of embroideries. He
wore on his head a sort of black fez, from under
which his sable curls fell hanging on his neck, while
his full beard, innocent of trimming, flowed amply
on his chest. His face was handsome and swarthy,
and had a not unkind expression. In figure he was
slight, and of medium height. He came from a
monastery in the Herzegovina, a province of Turkey
in Europe lying co-terminous to Montenegro on its
Northern border, and which, strange enough,
comes down at one point to the very sea at the
opening of the Fjord of Cattaro, thus thrusting
itself into and dividing the Austrian sea-board of
Dalmatia into two.
</p>

<p>
What was he coming to Montenegro for? Simply
to be inducted abbot of his own monastery, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
ceremony by right should have been performed
by the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople; but
although Herzegovina is subject to the Sultan, yet
all the Christian mountaineers of that region, though
not Montenegrins by blood, are Montenegrins at
heart, and all look to the Metropolitan at Cettigne
as their spiritual head, while to the Prince they
look up as the only sovereign to whom they owe
absolute allegiance.
</p>

<p>
The abbot elect rode a beautiful, small grey
<i>entero</i>, wonderfully quick and sure-footed, caparisoned
with gorgeous trappings, consisting of a
large blue saddle-cloth embroidered with gold, over
which lay an immense saddle of crimson velvet
studded with large gilt-headed nails. The bridle
was of the same Oriental style, while the bit was
something to be looked at, both as regards size,
ornament and power.
</p>

<p>
The Abbot sat his <i>entero</i>, as if riding at the
head of a party of Baschi-Bazouks would be quite
as much, if not more to his liking, than leading
the chaunts at matins and vespers in his own
monastery. There was nothing fierce about his
countenance, but there was a sort of "stand and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
deliver" look about his whole get up, that would
have made one feel somewhat anxious had one
chanced to meet him <i><span lang="it_IT">a quattr'occhi</span></i> in some lonely
pass.
</p>

<p>
Our caravan consisted in all of about twenty-five
persons, as we had been joined by several
parties all bent on the same excursion, to partake
of the rejoicings at Cettigne. First marched four
Montenegrins of the Prince's body-guard, splendid
specimens of their race, the shortest over six feet
high, with rich ruddy complexions, deeply bronzed
by exposure in all weathers, with dark grey or
blue eyes, dark brown, almost black hair, cut short,
close shaved beard and large moustachios, and
fine, open, manly countenances. They wore the
national costume of the country, namely, loose
baggy blue trousers, made very full and confined
under the knee by a strap, below that, their
legs were encased in tight-fitting white woollen
gaiters, fastened by a row of close-set small
metallic buttons all along the back, from the heel
to below the knee, while on their feet they
wore a peculiar pointed shoe of undressed leather,
the upper of which is contrived of numberless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
small thongs plaited up the middle over the
instep, which afford wonderful pliancy and power
of grasping to the feet, and are quite characteristic
of this region; a sleeveless crimson jacket, and
over all the well-known long surtout of fine white
cloth, without a collar, fastened round the waist
by an enormous silken scarf as much as eighteen
feet long, and which supported in front a perfect
armoury of weapons. First a yataghan three feet
long with richly ornamented sheath and handle,
then two highly ornamented Turkish pistols nearly
as long, then a poniard, and lastly a special pair
of tongs for lifting fire into their smoking pipes,
which, excepting when on duty, were never out
of their mouths. But as if such an armoury
were insufficient, they carried at their sides a
formidable-looking, highly curved Turkish sabre,
and over their shoulder a long, rakish, Albanian-looking,
breech-loading gun. This last they were
ever shifting in position, although the favourite
mode of carrying it seemed to be across the
shoulders, something like the way young ladies at
properly conducted schools are made to shoulder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
their backboards, with their hands hanging over
the stock and barrel.
</p>

<p>
We all followed pell-mell, sometimes in single
file, sometimes by twos, according as the inequality
of the path or its width, either prevented or
admitted of it, while the remainder of the guard
brought up the rear. So up we climbed, zigzag
after zigzag, some of us above and some of us
below until we reach the top of the <i>scala</i>
where Austrian territory ceases and Montenegro
begins.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now well up above the Eastern
horizon, when the sudden cessation of the road
gave us notice of our change of territory, and
looking round towards the Adriatic to which we
mostly had been turning our backs during the
ascent, we saw a view that I don't know which
would be most difficult, whether to sketch or to
describe.
</p>

<p>
I think we must have been at least three
thousand feet above the sea. At any rate,
owing to the steepness of the rocks on which
we stood, together with the clearness of the atmosphere,
the city of Cattaro seemed perpendicularly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
beneath us, while the coast of Dalmatia, the entire
canal of Cattaro with all its windings and the
many towns scattered on its coast, the forts at its
mouth, and the blue Adriatic beyond, seemed laid
out like a map at our feet.
</p>

<p>
The path, up which we had been toiling ever
since we left the town, lay in zigzags before
us like a white ribbon stretched out upon the
face of the precipice. It reminded me somewhat
of the pass of the Gemmi in Switzerland, but
was far more beautiful, while the bird's-eye view
of the town, with its fortress and its fortifications,
was most novel and astonishing. Perched as
we were almost perpendicularly over Cattaro,
and thus looking right down over their heads,
we could see its inhabitants only like black
specks moving about its miniature squares and
streets, while the old fortress with its crenelated
walls and its antiquated bastions, rising out of the
bluish haze which hung over the chasm that
yawns between the rock on which it is built
and the one on which we were standing, made
such a picture as Turner would have loved to
study.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was one of the most beautiful and extraordinary
sights I ever saw, and only lacked the
presence of foliage to make it perfect. But
total absence of timber is the characteristic of
the entire coast of Dalmatia, a fact much to be
regretted not only for the loss it is to the
country from a picturesque point of view, but
principally from the economical aspect of the
question—as well-managed forests would be of
immense value both from the timber they would
yield, and the increased humidity they would
afford to that arid region, where a sufficient rainfall
would increase the fertility, and consequently
the revenue more than a hundredfold.
</p>

<p>
If some of the millions which are yearly
wasted by the Austrian Government, as well as
by others too, in building ironclads and exploding
torpedoes, and in many other equally unreproductive
undertakings, were spent on the coast of
Dalmatia in planting olive trees on the side of
those mountains as far up as they could flourish,
then walnut trees, then chestnut trees, and
finally oaks and firs, I think I can safely assert
that in thirty years the full cost of the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
outlay would be repaid, while the benefit to the
country at large would be incalculable.
</p>

<p>
It is not in a book like this that the best
modes for bringing about the cultivation of the
Dalmatian shores of the Adriatic are to be discussed,
but that it could be done and should be done, is
undoubted; and not in Dalmatia alone, but also
to the east of that country, in the lands beyond
the Vellebitch, through Servia, and all that vast
tract of country subject now to the impoverishing
influence of Turkish mal-administration.
</p>

<p>
It always makes me sad when I think of those
rich countries lying fallow for want of hands to
cultivate them, and a good government to encourage
industry, and when I see shipload after shipload
of hard-working industrious Germans leaving
Hamburg, Bremen, and other German ports,
risking the perils, the inconveniences, and the
expenses of their voluntary exile, traversing
thousands of miles of ocean route to reach at
last an unknown country, from which it is
doubtful if they will ever have a chance of returning
to their Fatherland; when those fertile lands
of Servia lie at the very threshold of their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
country, with no sea to intervene, and only a few
days of rail and river to go over. But the present
state of things cannot continue for ever; and even
now promising signs of amendment are not wanting.
The monstrous anomaly of some of the richest
lands of Christian Europe being still in this
nineteenth century under the misrule of barbarous
Asiatic hordes, whilst millions of wretched Christian
inhabitants are kept in the most abject servitude,
must ere long be done away with; and all those
countries, Servia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Roumelia,
and all lying between the Danube and the Adriatic
must before very long be amalgamated under some
one chief. Who the man may be upon whom the
noble responsibility may fall of governing this
future empire, it is impossible now to conjecture,
for the several countries which would go to form
this new dominion are still scattered and disorganized;
but the great bond of a common
language will soon unite them again, when the time
comes, and probably that is not distant, for now we
do in weeks what our forefathers did in centuries.
When that moment shall come, I venture to
hope, in the interest of this new country, that one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
totally unconnected with the present contending
clans may assume the direction of affairs.
</p>

<p>
I know the man but I shall not name him.
Handsome in person, brave, courteous, highly
educated, and unsullied by any of those Eastern
vices which so frequently shock our Western
susceptibilities—equally unconnected with either
the Kara Georgevich or the Obrenovich parties—his
elevation to the throne of Servia would put a
stop to that system of hereditary vendetta which
seems for the present too deeply rooted in both
those clans to permit us to hope in its extinction at
least for a time, while it would extend to those
countries the benefits of that wise administration
which he has already so ably initiated in his own
country. But I must pull up my hobby-horse
sharp; he is already in full gallop, and if he once
gets the bit between his teeth, he will never check
his mad career till he stops at the gates of
Stamboul.

<p class="drop-cap">
DURING my stay in Montenegro, I
had the honour of several private
conversations with the Prince of that
interesting country, and I was astonished
at the amount of practical knowledge he
possessed, and the advanced views he entertained,
with regard to commerce, administration, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
political economy. But he is cramped up in every
way, Montenegro has no outlet, and though his
native mountains come so near to the Adriatic that
a man could almost spring from them into the
sea, still there is everywhere a narrow strip of
land between them and that sea, which effectually
excludes him from direct commercial or other intercourse
with the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
This strip of land, in some places only a few
yards wide, belongs to Austria and forms part of
the Province of Dalmatia. During the reign of
Napoleon I. the Principality of Montenegro extended
for a short period to the sea shore, and Cattaro was
occupied by the Montenegrins till the 14th June,
1814, when it was most unjustly taken away from
them again and incorporated with the Austrian
Empire by the Congress of Vienna. An act of
injustice all the more flagrant, that the Turkish
territory was allowed to come down to the sea at
the opening of the Gulf of Cattaro, dividing the
territory of Ragusa from that of Cattaro, and thus
affording the Mahommedan rulers of a Christian
land advantages which are denied to the neighbouring
Christian Principality.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But whilst I am admiring the scene before me
and pondering over the wrongs and the resources of
these interesting countries, I must not forget that
the sun is every moment getting higher in the
heavens, and that it is important to get on with
our journey, in order to avoid being out on those arid
rocks during the heat of the day.
</p>

<p>
Our caravan was now in motion again, but the
road having almost ceased to exist, we had to proceed
more cautiously, picking our way among loose
stones and boulders, sometimes following a sort of
path, and sometimes climbing up the dried up
water-courses of Winter torrents. After another
short interval of clambering, we reached a fountain
where everyone considered it his duty to dismount
and drink, as did also our cattle. When we had
refreshed ourselves with copious draughts from that
cool spring we again faced up the mountain, but
this time on foot, as owing to the steepness and
ruggedness of the rocks, it was not deemed
advisable to attempt it on horseback.
</p>

<p>
Except climbing up the cone of Vesuvius, where
one generally makes two steps in advance and three
steps backwards, I never met anything more trying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
than some parts of this ascent into Tchernagora
or the "Black Mountains," as the natives called
this region, and which was rendered by the Venetians
into "Montenegro," the name it retains to
this day.
</p>

<p>
The sun was becoming extremely hot, and I
should have found it considerably difficult to keep
my place, but for the occasional assistance afforded
me by the powerful hand and arm of my Prince
of Mountaineers, Pero Pejovich, who whenever
I came to some rugged impediment which seemed
to tax my energies more than usual, would quickly,
with one hand passed under my arms close below
my shoulder, lift me bodily over it, with his broad
good-humoured face beaming with smiles; and
when I tell you, gentle reader, that I sometimes
weigh <i>more</i> but never less than fourteen stone, I
leave you to calculate the strength of my amiable
giant.
</p>

<p>
We had now topped the worst of our ascent,
and remounting our horses commenced a short descent
to a little plain surrounded by steep, rugged, barren
rocks seemingly the bed of some ancient dried up
lake. At the further extremity of this little plain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
could be seen half-a-dozen scattered houses forming
the village of Niegosch, the birth-place of the
Prince of Montenegro, as well as the cradle of his
race, from which they take their patronimic of
Petrovich Niegosch.
</p>

<p>
We rode up straight to the principal house where
we were expected and received by a young
Petrovich, a cousin of the Prince, a very handsome
young fellow, with whom unfortunately I could
only have conversation by the help of Pero
Pejovich, who speaking Italian as well as Montenegrin,
always proved himself a most valuable
interpreter.
</p>

<p>
We made a very short stay here, as we wanted
to reach Cettigne before the middle of the day; so
having partaken of some excellent coffee, served up
with toast and such clotted cream as I never before
tasted out of Devonshire, and having admired the
gorgeous arms which hung round young Petrovich's
room, each of which had some story attached to it,
all being trophies taken in battle from the Turks,
we mounted our horses, and again plunging into
a ravine recommenced the difficult ascent.
</p>

<p>
After a short but arduous climb, we at length
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
reached the top of the pass and the highest point
between Cattaro and Cettigne. Here a wonderful
panorama spread itself out before us—not beautiful,
perhaps, but grand in its way. Right, left, and
front, nothing could be seen but barren, grey
mountain tops—except right in front of us, where
at a short distance lay the valley of Cettigne, also
apparently the bed of an ancient Alpine lake.
Beyond that plain the bleak and rocky mountains
closed in again; and beyond them, far in
the hazy distance, shining in the noon-day sun,
could be seen the glittering lake of Scutari,
or more properly of Skodra, in Northern
Albania.
</p>

<p>
A scene like this could scarcely be conceived, such
a wilderness of rocks, such a picture of sterility,
had never met my eyes. Peak after peak, desolate
and barren, rose in every direction, as far as the
sight could reach; and as the point on which
we stood must have been more than four thousand
feet above the sea, the distance we could
see in that bright clear atmosphere may be
imagined.
</p>

<p>
The rocks of which those mountains are formed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
looked ashy grey in the bright sunlight, except here
and there in some of the ravines where a scanty,
scrubby vegetation, struggling for existence, offered
a precarious subsistence to considerable flocks of
small wild goats, herded by still wilder-looking
children. These grey rocky masses, when it rains,
become of a dark slate colour, nearly black, and
hence arose the name of the country, Tchernagora.
</p>

<p>
To account for the presence of such immense
quantities of stones in their country, the Montenegrins
have a legend which says that after the Creator
had made this earth, the Devil was permitted to go
and scatter stones all over it. He carried the stones
in a bag over his shoulder, but as he passed in his
flight over their country, the bag suddenly
burst, and thus a greater share of stones fell
to their lot than they were fairly entitled
to.
</p>

<p>
I don't know which was the most fatiguing, the
climb up to the top of the pass, or the scramble
down; I think the latter, and if I did reach the
bottom without a fall or a sprained ankle, I owe
it all to my excellent fellow-traveller, Pero Pejovich,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
who kept a sturdy hold of me all through, and
saved me, I am sure, from many an ugly
tumble.
</p>

<p>
At last we found ourselves in the little plain of
Cettigne, and putting spurs to our small horses
cantered over the turf till we reached the first
houses of the straggling street which constitutes the
capital of one of the most interesting countries in
Europe.
</p>

<p>
The next travellers who visit Cettigne will find
there good accommodation in a spacious hotel,
which was all but completed before I left; but
when I was there, nothing existed in the shape of
an inn except a couple of very wretched khans,
where it would have been difficult to get rest,
owing to the activity of the insect population and
the total absence of every accommodation. Thanks
to the liberal hospitality of His Highness, I was
provided, by his orders, with apartments in the
ancient fortified palace of the Vladikas, or Prince-Bishops
of Montenegro, to which I was conducted
by one of His Highness's aide-de-camps, who
had come to meet me. This gentleman had been
educated in France, at the Military School of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
Cyr, spoke French like a Parisian, and was most
kind in never allowing me to want for anything.
Guessing that I did not know a word of Slave, he
had most thoughtfully appointed a man in the
town, who could speak a few words of Italian, to
attend me during my stay, and to provide me daily
with food from a sort of very primitive restaurant
in the place.
</p>

<p>
Having rested a couple of hours after eating an
early dinner, according to the fashion of southern
countries, I received a visit from Mr. Nico Matanovich,
the gentleman alluded to above, and to
whom I was indebted for the comfort with which
I was installed, who in company with the Russian
Consul (who was residing at the new Palace with
the Prince), came to propose a walk about the
place as soon as the sun should be somewhat nearer
to the horizon. Having ordered up coffee, as is
always expected in these countries, Mr. Nico Matanovich
conveyed to me the agreeable information
that His Highness would receive me the following
day at eleven o'clock in the morning. In reply,
I begged he would present my humble respects to
His Highness, and my unbounded thanks for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
the handsome manner in which I was treated.
</p>

<p>
The sun being now sufficiently low, we sallied
forth to take a turn round the place, and see what
was to be seen. But before I leave my quarters,
let me try to give some idea of the Vladika's
Palace, where I was lodged. This quaint old
building consists of a quadrangle of about a hundred
and fifty paces<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> either way, surrounded by a
very massive and high wall, pierced by two large
roofed-in gateways, one in front and one at the
side, and having at each corner a round squat
tower with a conical roof, reminding one somewhat
of those that surround, at intervals, the Kremlin at
Moscow. Running midway from side to side, and
dividing this enclosure into about two equal parts is
the palace itself, which consists of two stories, the
second of which is divided into a series of chambers,
each about sixteen feet square and ten feet high,
all opening into each other, and communicating
also at the back with a wide corridor which goes
the whole length of the building. The windows,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
of which there are two to each room, look into
the front compartment of the quadrangle, while
the windows of the corridor look on the back.
</p>

<p>
The entrance is by a hall door from which one
ascends at once to the upper story, by means of a
massive wooden staircase formed of solid beams of
timber roughly hewn. The lower story has been
turned partly into an arsenal, principally filled with
ancient weapons taken from the Turks, and partly
into a Government school; the upper rooms are
occupied at one end by the Archimandrite and
some other officials—the rest are untenanted. In
the centre of the front court-yard is a deep well of
the most delicious water, and so cold that I used
it to cool my wine and beer with nearly as much
success as if I had been using snow. The back
compartment was a kitchen-garden and orchard.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the old Palace by the side gate which
opens upon one of the two streets that constitute
the town of Cettigne, we found ourselves opposite
to the new Palace lately built by the Prince—the
style of which I in no wise admire, though I do
not doubt it is comfortable enough inside; but it
has no character whatever, and looks insignificant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
when compared with the old Palace. If the money
spent on building the new had been judiciously
laid out in adding to the old, a truly fine Palace
could have been erected, with all the old characteristics
preserved, which the eyes of the people,
as well as of travellers, would have had an historical
stamp as the abode of all the old Vladikas, those
ancient Prince-Bishops—Bishops of the Church
Militant—who for many years had valiantly defended
their country, their liberty, and their faith
against the unceasing attacks of the Infidels.
</p>

<p>
Opposite this gate, and just midway in the very
broad street between the old and the new Palace,
stands a large carob tree, with a stone bench of
roughly hewn blocks round its trunk, and here in
Summer from about nine o'clock every morning
the Prince sits for some hours administering justice.
I often watched him with the greatest interest from
a window in the old Palace. It was like acting a
chapter in the Old Testament—Deborah judging
Israel under a palm tree, "between Ramah and
Beth-el in Mount Ephraim!" Beyond the "Tree
of Justice" one came to the new Palace, a homely
structure, as I said before, and of no pretence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
At the gate two sentries of the Prince's bodyguard,
in full Montenegrin costume, mount guard,
and are constantly relieved every hour, their
barracks being exactly opposite. The process of
relieving guard is very simple—two privates walk
out of the barracks with their long breechloaders
over their shoulders "<i><span lang="fr_FR">à volonté</span></i>," and take their
station on each side of the gateway of the Palace,
while the other two walk back into barracks,
and that is all.
</p>

<p>
We now turned our backs on the "Tree of Justice,"
and walked up the street, which is but short,
until we came to the main street which crosses it
at right angles. This main street is not paved, but
is wide, and the houses on each side, though
seemingly poor and wretched in the extreme in our
eyes, are, most probably, comfortable enough in
theirs; and as they do not even possess a word in
their language to denote "comfort," what we would
consider such, would, perhaps, be only considered
by them an uneasy restraint.
</p>

<p>
Turning now to the right we walked to the
end of the street, where is the new hotel with
the post and telegraph office. The hotel, as I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
previously said, was not yet opened, though the
building was completed, and when supplied with
beds, tables, and chairs will be a very creditable
affair, incomparably better than any hotel in
Dalmatia. Near the hotel, a little to the left, is
another modern institution, evincing in no small
degree the enlightened anxiety of the Prince for
the advancement of his country. It is a <i><span lang="fr_FR">Pensionnat
de demoiselles</span></i> for the education of the daughters of
the better classes, both of Montenegro and the
surrounding countries; it can accommodate forty
pupils, and is superintended by a charming and
highly accomplished Russian lady, assisted by
efficient governesses. The charge being very small,
only £20 per annum, it must be largely subsidized
by His Highness.
</p>

<p>
Being vacation time, I had not the satisfaction
of seeing any of the boarders, much to the regret
of Mademoiselle Pakievitch, who kindly showed
me all over the institution, which was admirably
neat and clean. She was anxious that I should
have heard some of the pupils speak English and
French. "I think you would have been both
pleased and surprised," said she. The majority
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
spoke Illyrian, Russian and German, while several
were proficient in addition with both English and
French, and one with Albanian also. The institution
is under the special patronage of the Empress of
Russia, who takes the greatest interest in it, and constantly
sends presents to it.
</p>

<p>
Keeping now a little to the right, and following
the path which leads to the town of Rieka,
we soon came to the foot of the crags which on
that side close in with an impassable barrier the
little plain of Cettigne. We now turned sharp
round and set our faces towards the town, as the
lengthening shadows warned us that the sun was
already setting behind the mountains which we had
traversed in the morning. The smooth plain
covered with short grass was delightful to walk
over, though one had to be careful of one's steps
owing to the many wells with which it is dotted
for the purpose of getting water for the cattle,
and which, quite level with the ground and without
the semblance of a parapet, might have swallowed
one up before one would have had time to see
them.
</p>

<p>
Right before us, standing a little to the left and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
just beyond the old palace, could be seen in the
distance the ancient monastery which in old times
used to be occupied by the Archimandrite, in the
days when the Vladika used to inhabit the palace;
but now that Church and State are separated, it is
occupied by Monsignor Roganovitch, the Metropolitan
of Montenegro.
</p>

<p>
Just above it, perched upon a rock and standing
out in bold relief against the glowing sky, could
be seen the old tower of Cettigne, an ancient piece
of masonry which until three or four years ago
used to be constantly decorated with the heads of
Turks killed and decapitated in their several
skirmishes and forays. This barbarous custom
has now been abandoned, never to be resumed again
it is to be hoped, and the present Prince, further to
turn away the thoughts of the natives from the
barbarous habit of their forefathers, has caused a
belfry to be erected on the top of the tower wherein
is placed a large bell, which is only rung in cases
of great alarm to gather the tribes. The bell is
very heavy, and much ingenuity and labour were
required to transport it on men's backs from Cattaro
to Cettigne.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
</p>

<p>
By the time we got back to the Palace it
was dark, so wishing good night to my kind
friends I made a frugal supper and went to
bed.

<p class="drop-cap">
I AWOKE early the next morning,
having slept most luxuriously on a
spring mattress and totally unmolested
by fleas, thanks to the ample supply
of flea-powder thoughtfully strewn by my attendant,
between the mattress and the undersheet.
</p>

<p>
The insect powder of Montenegro is celebrated,
you must know, in Eastern and Southern Europe,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
and I can vouch for its excellence. It consists
simply in the small dried flower of some species of
Pyrethrum, which when wanted for use is ground
in a coffee-mill and strewed about the bed. The
plant is found abundantly all over Montenegro,
and owes its greater virtue to the fact of being
grown in very arid soil, untempered by the slightest
moisture, and exposed to scorching suns—everything
about it therefore is in the most concentrated
form, and hence its efficacy; it is a very considerable
article of commerce, and is largely exported to
Russia and the Levant.
</p>

<p>
It was not therefore due to insect attacks that I
was so early disturbed from my slumbers on
the following morning; still I was disturbed, and
that by the momentarily increasing hum of
many voices and general bustle of the thousands
who were flocking to Cettigne for the festival
which was to take place on the morrow; but the
great day of the feast throughout the south of
Europe is invariably the day before the feast, "<span lang="it_IT">la
vigilia del Santo</span>," as the wording goes. The day
of the feast itself one confesses, goes to mass, and
does the proper; all the fun and the rollicking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
is generally the day before. So I got up, and
pushing open the outside green shutters which
secured my windows, I looked into the courtyard of
the Palace, and over the walls beyond into the little
plain, which was gradually filling with numberless
men, women, and children, some on horseback,
more on foot, but all gorgeously attired.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now getting high on the horizon,
and the scene before me was becoming more and
more animated and interesting. In the open space
under my window, within the high enclosure of
the Palace wall, men were busy picketing a dozen
horses, evidently from the costliness of their trappings
belonging to Chiefs and Woyvodes. While
under a group of carob trees, in one corner of
the enclosure, were spread several rugs on which
were sitting cross-legged some of the owners
of those quadrupeds, with their clumsy high-backed
saddles behind them, passively smoking their
chibouks while their attendants busied themselves
preparing coffee.
</p>

<p>
Close on my right and just beyond the old Palace
was the monastery, which, owing to the lateness of
the hour the evening before, I had been unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
examine. Like the old Palace it is a sort of semi-fortified
building, constructed more for safety than
for comfort. On the right hand, as the observer
looks at it in front, is the church, and next to it a
tall, square, and very modern tower erected to the
memory of the Vladika Peter, who is buried on the
top of a somewhat difficult peak to the south-west
of Cettigne and about six miles distant. The body
of the monastery comes next, conspicuous by two
rows of arched openings placed one over the other,
and to the left of them again are the apartments
of the Metropolitan. The whole is surrounded by
a high wall, enclosing a primitive garden in which
are located a large number of beehives, (upwards of
a hundred). This wall is pierced by one large
gateway, roofed over and secured by a massive
door, in front of which is the circular-paved
thrashing floor, so characteristic of the East. Every
thing about the monastery is of the simplest and
rudest construction, and the church is utterly unadorned,
not from choice, I am assured, but from
necessity.
</p>

<p>
In the monastery itself are many shady corners
that would well repay a few hours spent in transferring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
them to one's portfolio, and just at the
entrance inside the building, is a most extraordinary
chasm in the rock, through which a piercing cold
wind is constantly blowing, coldest when the
weather is hottest; and so intense is the cold in
that opening that it is used in Summer as an
ice-house for the cooling of wine and the preserving
of food. This phenomenon has never been satisfactorily
explained, because it is not only that the
cavity is cold, but a strong sharp cutting wind
rushes out of it. I shall not attempt to account for
it, but will leave it as a problem for sharper wits
than mine to solve.
</p>

<p>
As the day waxed older the number of arrivals
increased on the plain of Cettigne, till by eight
o'clock in the morning it was dotted all over
with picketed horses and temporary encampments
of all sorts. Having had my simple breakfast of
coffee, milk, and toast without butter—which is
quite unknown there though cream is plentiful—but
accompanied by a good plate of Albanian figs,
I went out with Pero Pejovich, who came to fetch
me to visit the fair. For this festival of St. Peter
offers a double stimulus to the inhabitants of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
surrounding country for a visit to Cettigne—a
religious ceremony and a considerable fair. And it
may be right for me to observe that this St.
Peter, Patron of Montenegro, in whose honour
this great gathering annually takes place, is a saint
<i><span lang="la">sui generis</span></i>—indeed I was on the point of saying,
when I detected and checked myself, that he was
a saint <i><span lang="la">extra palum ecclesiæ</span></i>; for he is neither St.
Peter the Apostle, nor St. Peter the Martyr, nor
St. Peter the Hermit, nor even St. Peter Igneus,
who in a fit of zeal for the maintenance of the
laws relating to the temporalities of the church,
walked through the flames at Settimo in the
eleventh century, to establish a case of simony
against another Peter, one Peter of Pavia, then
Bishop of Florence; nor any other canonical St.
Peter I ever heard of, but simply St. Peter of
Montenegro, the old Vladika Peter I., Prince-Bishop
of Montenegro, not yet canonized by any
ecclesiastical authority or other licensing body, as I
was assured, but simply a saint in virtue of the will of
the people, the Plebiscite of Montenegro, who insisted
<i><span lang="it_IT">autoritate nostra</span></i> on having him for their patron
saint. He probably deserved to be canonized just as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
well, and perhaps better than many another saint,
and if history tells truth, certainly better than his
namesake, the so-called Peter the Martyr, for he
wisely, mildly, and virtuously ruled in Montenegro
for fifty-three years, viz., from 1777 to 1830, and
the mountaineers are fully justified in reverencing
his memory.
</p>

<p>
Passing my arm through that of Pero Pejovich,
who seemed to know and be known of everyone,
I began my expedition through a crowd of men,
women and children, that every moment grew
denser and denser. It was the most picturesque
scene that could be imagined; all the neighbouring
and surrounding countries had sent their contributions
to the fair—Bosnians, Servians, Herzegovinians,
Morlacks, Dalmatians, Albanians, Roumelians,
Turks, Greeks, Croats, Italians, &amp;c.; but
conspicuous among them all for height of stature
and nobility of countenance were the Montenegrins
themselves. I think that, even independent
of their costume, I could have always singled
them out by their ruddy though sunburnt complexions,
grey or blue eyes, and open honest
countenances.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We went to a booth where arms were sold,
and I was astounded at the number, variety, and
richness of the weapons that were not only displayed,
but were actually sold. They seemed to
me dear. I should have much liked to purchase
a handsome yataghan with silver hilt and in a
sheath of <i>repoussé</i> silver. It was a very handsome
weapon, and was made by a celebrated artificer of
Skodra, but the price was sixteen Napoleons, which
was more than I liked to give, and I suspect I could
get one just like it in Tichborne Street for half the
money.
</p>

<p>
From the armourer we went to a tailor's booth,
where piles of costumes of different nationalities
were exposed for sale; Morlack suits, Albanian
suits, and Montenegrin suits, some of cloth and
some of velvet, but all more or less embroidered
in gold, and some literally overladen with plates
of silver gilt. From thence we went to a Bosnian
<i>café</i> of the most primitive kind; a couple of large
blankets stretched over a few poles made a
pretence of shelter, and on the ground were
a few Turkish rugs on which we squatted, while
a very ugly and dirty gipsy-looking woman was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
boiling coffee outside over a small fire of sticks
contrived between two stones; nothing could be
more primitive. So we sat and smoked, and in
due time drank our coffee, which was simply
abominable. I remember it was, though I was
not minding it much, being occupied at the time
with listening to a man performing on the national
instrument, the <i>guzla</i> (pronounced goozla), whilst
a girl was singing a low, monotonous, plaintive
air.
</p>

<p>
The <i>guzla</i> is not an instrument which offers
much scope to the performer; it is simply a very
primitive fiddle, with only one string, played upon
with an equally primitive bow; still it was surprising
the amount of harmony the man contrived
to scrape out of it. The song, as Pero Pejovich
told me, was all about the old story, love and
war, while the music, as is almost always the
case among barbarous nations, was in a minor
key.
</p>

<p>
Having paid for our coffee and thrown a
few paràs to the minstrels, we sallied forth
again.
</p>

<p>
"And now, friend Pero," I said, "I should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
like to see some of your Montenegrin beauties. I
have seen lots of fine men this morning; but as to
the women, friend Pero, they are a caution.
I never saw so many ugly ones congregated together."
</p>

<p>
My conductor smiled, shrugged his shoulders,
and looked me in the face; he did not know exactly
whether he ought not to be angry. However, his
habitual good-humour prevailed, and with a loud
laugh, he said:
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="it_IT">Avete ragione, son brutte come il Demonio</span>.</i> But
wait, only wait till you see the Princess; she is a
pure Montenegrina, and beautiful enough for the
whole nation." And he spoke truth!
</p>

<p>
We now wandered away again towards a sort
of native inn or khan, where he said we should get
some good Vienna beer to wash away the taste
of that abominable coffee. As we were passing
some booths, where a variety of cheap Manchester
goods were being displayed with some English Delft
ware of the very commonest description, I was
hailed with a "How d'ye do, stranger?" from a
dapper, wide-awake-looking little man, who came
out and spoke such excellent English that I took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
him to be a Briton or an American; but he was
neither; he was a Dalmatian from Sebenico, who
had been a great deal in England and America,
and spoke English as fluently as his native Illyrian.
I had a long chat with him, and asked him how trade
was, and if he was doing well.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied; "they don't know what trade
is in these countries, they have too many restrictions;
and yet," said he, "you won't go into the poorest
cabin that you won't find one of these," handing
me a wretched sample of English pottery with a
vile brown pattern on it; "such is their preference
for everything of English make."
</p>

<p>
Here Pero reminded me of the beer we had to
drink, and that the time was drawing near when I
was to present myself at the Palace for my audience.
So we went off to the khan, where, having refreshed
ourselves with some of Vienna's best, with a lump of
virgin snow in it, I bid my guide good morning,
and returned to the old Palace; when, having
dressed myself, I crossed over to the new one to pay
my respects to the Prince according to the orders
received the day before.
</p>

<p>
Having penetrated through the outer gate, where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
the guards, I thought, looked rather scowlingly
on my strange attire—viz., a dark blue frock
coat, light grey trousers, and patent leather boots,
the whole topped with my Indian quilted helmet—I
ascended to the hall door by half a dozen steps,
where I was met by the Prince's own henchman, a
brother of the Commandant of the Grahovo. He
was yet taller than his brother, and must have
been at least six feet eight inches. I do not say this
quite by guess-work, though I did not actually
measure him; but on a subsequent occasion I did
measure an immense Montenegrin, and found him
six feet seven inches without heels, and the henchman
was decidedly taller than he.
</p>

<p>
Well, <i><span lang="fr_FR">pour revenir à nos moutons</span></i>, I followed my
Goliath into the hall, which is small and low,
terminating in a double staircase, that bending
round from each side joins again in the middle to
form but one flight, at the top of which I found
myself in a vestibule with two more guards on duty,
and from that I was ushered into a fine large and
well proportioned room, handsomely furnished in
Viennese style, and hung all round with good
portraits of the Prince's father, the celebrated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
Mirko, the Emperor and Empress of Russia, the
Emperor and Empress of Austria, and many
others.
</p>

<p>
Rooms open right and left off this. I was
conducted into a smaller room to the right, where,
after waiting for only a few seconds, the Prince
came in. He addressed me in French, congratulating
me on my courage for having ventured so far
into his country, not on account of the difficulty
of the road, "for all English are good mountaineers,"
but from the bad name the country has in
Europe.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know," said he, laughing, "<span lang="fr_FR">que nous
sommes des ogres, et que nous mangeons les
enfans</span>; however, you shall try how we cook them
if you will dine here to-night at eight."
</p>

<p>
I thanked His Highness for his kindness, adding
that I had never heard of their cannibal propensities,
but in any case I should be happy to eat anything
His Highness also would eat, and making my bow
backed out of the saloon.
</p>

<p>
I then left my card for the Russian Consul, who
was staying at the Palace, and afterwards went to pay
the same compliment to Mr. Nico Matanovich, aide-de-camp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
to the Prince; after which I returned to my
quarters, to convert into a luncheon the repast which
otherwise would have served for a dinner, but for
the hospitality of His Highness.

<p class="drop-cap">
I NOW discovered what a terrible
nuisance it is to know only three or
four languages, especially when one
finds oneself in a country the language
of which is a complete mystery. The attendant
I had, who had been so thoughtfully provided
for me by Mr. Matanovich, professed to
speak Italian, and he did in fact know a few
Italian words, but in his general conversation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
with me, as was subsequently discovered and explained
to me by Pero Pejovich, the language in
which he spoke consisted pretty much of the following
happy mixture: six-tenths of Montenegrin,
three-tenths of Albanian and Turkish, with one-tenth
Italian! With this polyglot jumble we got
on fairly well, as far as hot water, coffee, pipe,
tobacco, pranzo; and he learned to appreciate
eventually the American word "skedaddle," but
when our necessities required further intercourse,
it was perfectly hopeless—language was utterly
useless, and gesticulation the only chance of making
oneself understood. But he was a willing poor
beggar, and not more dishonest than the majority
of his fellows. He had a wholesome terror of the
Prince's rigorous punishment of theft. "<i><span lang="it_IT">Niente
ladri in Montenegro</span></i>," he used to say, "<i>Principe
terrible</i>," turning up his eyes and distorting his
countenance to a fearful degree.
</p>

<p>
Now whilst my attendant is preparing and setting
out my lunch, I may as well entertain my reader
with an account of the customs in war, and mode
of fighting of the Montenegrins, by the pen of
M. Broniewsky, which is so graphic, and accords
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
so literally with what the Commandant Pero
Pejovich related to me at different times, that I
cannot think I could do better than transcribe
it.
</p>

<p>
"A Montenegrin is always armed, and carries
about during his most peaceful occupation a rifle
(many of them now have breechloaders), pistol, or
yataghan, and a cartouche-box. The Montenegrins
spend their leisure time in firing at a target, and
are accustomed to this exercise from their boyish
years. Being inured to hardships and privations,
they perform without fatigue, and in high spirits,
very long and forced marches. They climb the
steepest rocks with great facility, and bear with
the greatest patience hunger, thirst, and every
kind of privation. When the enemy is defeated
and retiring, they pursue him with such rapidity
that they supply the want of cavalry, which it
is impossible to employ in their mountainous
country.
</p>

<p>
"Inhabiting mountains which present, at every
step, passes where a handful of brave men may
arrest the progress of an army, they are not
afraid of a surprise, particularly as they have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
on their frontier a constant guard, and the whole
of their force can be collected within twenty-four
hours upon the threatened point. When
the enemy is in great force, they burn their
villages, devastate their fields, and after having
enticed him into the mountains, they surround
and attack him in the most desperate
manner.
</p>

<p>
"When the country is in danger, the Montenegrins
forget all personal feelings of private advantage and
enmity. They obey the orders of their chief, and
like gallant Republicans, they consider it a happiness
and a grace of God to die in battle. It is in
such a case that they appear as real warriors; but
beyond the limits of their country, they are savage
barbarians, who destroy everything with fire and
sword.
</p>

<p>
"Their ideas about war are entirely different from
those adopted by civilized nations. They cut off
the heads of those enemies whom they take with
arms in their hands, and spare only those who
surrender before the battle. The property they take
from the enemy is considered by them as their own,
and as a reward of courage. They literally defend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
themselves to the last extremity; a Montenegrin
never craves for mercy; and whenever one of them
is severely wounded, and it is impossible to save
him from the enemy, his own comrades cut off his
head. When at the attack of Clobuk, a little
detachment of our troops was obliged to retreat,
an officer of stout-make and no longer young fell
on the ground from exhaustion. A Montenegrin
perceiving it (the Montenegrins were fighting with
the Russians against the French) ran immediately to
him, and having drawn his yataghan, said 'You
are very brave and must wish that I should cut off
your head; say a prayer and make a sign of the
cross.' The officer horrified at the proposition
made an effort to rise, and rejoined his comrades
with the assistance of the friendly Montenegrin.
</p>

<p>
"They consider all those taken by the enemy as
killed. They carry out of the battle their wounded
comrades on their shoulders; and be it said to their
honour they acted in the same manner by our
officers and soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"Like the Circassians, they are constantly making
forays in small parties, for the plunder of cattle,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
and consider such expeditions as feats of chivalry,
(just as the Scotch Highlanders one hundred years
ago). Being safe in their habitations, where
nobody dares to molest them, they continue their
depredations with impunity, disregarding the threats
of the Divan, and the hatred of their neighbours.
Arms, a small loaf of bread, a cheese, some garlic,
a little brandy, an old garment, and two pair of
sandals, made of raw hide, form all the equipage of
a Montenegrin. On the march they do not seek
any shelter from rain or cold. In rainy weather,
the Montenegrin wraps up his head in his strooka,
lies down on the ground, and sleeps very
comfortably. Three or four hours' repose are
quite sufficient for his rest, and the remainder
of his time is occupied in constant exertion.
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible to retain them in the reserve;
and it seems they cannot calmly bear the view of
the enemy. When they have expended all their
cartouches, they humbly request every officer they
meet with to give them some, and as soon as they
have received them, they run headlong into the
further line. When there is no enemy in sight,
they sing and dance, and go on pillaging, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
we must give them the credit of being perfect
masters; although they are not acquainted with
the high sounding names of contribution, requisition,
forced loan, &amp;c., &amp;c. They call pillage,
simply 'pillage,' and have no hesitation in confessing
it.
</p>

<p>
"Their usual manner of fighting is as follows: If
they are in great force, they conceal themselves in
ravines, and send out only a small number of
shooters, who by retreating lead the enemy into
the ambush; here, after having surrounded him,
they attack him, usually preferring on such occasions
swords to fire-arms; because they rely
on their personal strength and bravery, in which
they generally have the advantage over their
enemies. When their numbers are inferior, they
choose some advantageous position on high rocks,
where pronouncing every kind of abuse against
their enemies, they challenge them to combat.
Their attacks are mostly made during the night,
because their principal system is surprise.
</p>

<p>
"However small their force may be, they always
try to wear out the enemy by constantly harassing
him. The best French <i><span lang="fr_FR">voltigeurs</span></i> in the advanced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
posts were always destroyed by them; and the
enemy's generals found it more advantageous to
remain under cover of their cannon, of which the
Montenegrins were not at all fond. However,
they soon became accustomed to them, and supported
by our rifles, they bravely mounted the
batteries.
</p>

<p>
"The tactics of Montenegrins are confined to
being skilful marksmen.... In a pitched battle
their movements can be ascertained only by the
direction of their standards. They have certain
signal cries, which are uttered when they are to
join in a compact body for attacking the weaker
points of the enemy. As soon as such a signal
is given, they rush furiously onwards, break
into the squares, and at all events create a deal
of disorder in the enemy's ranks. It was a terrible
spectacle to see the Montenegrins rushing forward,
with heads of slaughtered enemies suspended
from their necks and shoulders, and uttering savage
yells....
</p>

<p>
"The Russian commander-in-chief had much
difficulty in persuading them not to cut off the
heads of their prisoners. He finally succeeded in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
this (chiefly by paying them a ducat for every
prisoner) but what he had more difficulty, with the
assistance of the Vladika, in persuading them to do,
was to embark for an expedition on board of ship—a
thing which they had never done before.
</p>

<p>
"Notwithstanding that they were treated with the
greatest kindness, they proved very troublesome
guests. Whenever the captains invited their chiefs
to breakfast, they all entered the cabin, and having
observed that more dishes were served to the
officers than to common sailors, they wanted to
have a similar fare. When the Fortress of Curzola
was taken the feast of Easter was approaching; they
gave the captain no repose, entreating him to
return to Cattaro; but when it was explained to
them that the vessel could not advance against
the wind, they fell into great despondency.
</p>

<p>
"When at last the ship approached the entrance
of Boccha di Cattaro and they caught a sight of
their own black mountains, they uttered joyous
exclamations, and began to sing and dance. On
taking leave they affectionately embraced the captain
and the officers, and invited those to whom they
had taken a liking to pay them a visit. But when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
the sailors told them they could not leave the ship
without the permission of their superiors, they
were much astonished, and said, 'If you like
to do a thing, what right has another to forbid
you?'"
</p>

<p>
Does not the foregoing read like a chapter in
"Waverley," or in "Rob Roy?" but though it is
now a good many years since M. Broniewski wrote
the foregoing, the Montenegrin is still much the
same, with the exception of cutting off the heads
of those killed in battle, which he has given up,
principally, I believe, because he has had no fighting
of late. But at the period of the last attempted
invasion of Montenegro on the Grahovo side, by
the Turks in, I think, 1862, heads were cut off
as freely as ever, and were liberally paid for by
the chieftains; the only difference was that instead
of taking them to Cettigne to hang in festoons
upon the round tower at the back of the monastery,
they were allowed to rot on the battle-field among
the rocks of the Grahovo where scores of them are
to be seen lying about to this day.

I REGRET more than I can express
having lost some interesting notes of
several conversations I had with the
Commandant Pedro Pejovich on the
subject of the campaign of 1864(?); all the more
as they were most graphically told me by him, who
had been in the thick of the fight, and carried in
his body, in the shape of severe wounds, proofs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
of the active part he had borne in that campaign.
One only I partially remember still, sufficiently
well to venture to retail.
</p>

<p>
The Turks, apparently, were attacking the Montenegrins
from the Herzegovina in the north of
Montenegro. They numbered about twelve thousand
men, together with a good force of Artillery;
while the Montenegrins collected to oppose them
were not more than two thousand; but whilst the
Turks were in the plain fully exposed in sight
of the Montenegrins, these sturdy mountaineers,
finding covert behind each rock and bramble bush,
were able to pick off the Turks with considerable
effect. Still the disparity of force was too great,
and at the end of the second day's fighting, although
the Turks had not been able to make any impression
on the position held by the Montenegrins,
still the number of those killed and wounded bore
a very large proportion to their numbers. At
sunset the fight being over for the time, and sentries
having been posted by the mountaineers as
far forward as practicable to watch the Ottoman
camp, Prince Mirko, father of the present Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
of Montenegro, then in command of the Montenegrins,
summoned all the chiefs to a brief council
of war, and spoke thus:
</p>

<p>
"Two days we have been fighting the infidels,
and the only result has been the losses we have
sustained in killed and wounded. Another day of
such fighting will leave us so crippled that the
accursed Turks will walk over us into our homes
and villages. There is but one plan which offers
any hope, but if you adopt it and place faith in
me, I promise you a complete victory before to-morrow's
sun shall gild the tops of yonder
mountains. To-morrow morning, one hour before
daylight, be all ready to follow me, leave behind
your rifles and ammunition, and follow me softly
and stealthily, making no noise; so we shall pass
the Turkish advanced sentries without their noticing
us, and when sufficiently near I will call my cry,
and then let you all rush forward with me, trusting
solely to your yataghans, and give no
quarter."
</p>

<p>
This was carried out to the letter, and succeeded
perfectly. The Turks, never imagining they would
be attacked, kept a bad look-out. The Montenegrins,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
led on by the intrepid Mirko, rushed on the
Turkish batteries, cutting the gunners' heads off,
and having spiked the cannons attacked the
remainder of the army with such impetuosity
that they fled from the field in the utmost disorder.
</p>

<p>
This was the last attack of the Turks against
Montenegro, and I don't think they will ever try
it again. Prince Mirko was dead before my visit
to this country. I cannot therefore give any
description of him personally, but from all I heard
he must have been a very remarkable man in
every way. Though small in stature and slight,
contrary to the general build of the Montenegrins,
who are mostly all very tall and powerful men,
he had immense influence over the mountain-tribes;
owing to his well known sagacity and his fierce
courage, wherever Mirko would lead, the whole
of Montenegro would follow. He had the eye of
an eagle, and strength of will and determination
are portrayed in every line of his face, as I have
observed in his portrait which hangs in the Palace
of Montenegro, as well as the photograph I have
seen of him. But he was wise also; when Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
Danielo (the predecessor of the present ruler) died
by the hand of an assassin at Cattaro, his widow,
the Princess Darinka, at once caused the present
Prince, Nicholas I. (nephew of the murdered
Danielo) to be proclaimed sovereign, passing over
his father Mirko, who, owing to the great youth
of his son, might have expected and claimed the
succession; but as I said above, Mirko was wise
as well as valorous. He knew that from his own
warlike tendencies, how much soever he might be
acceptable to his own mountaineers, his elevation to
be ruler of Tchernagora would be displeasing to
most of his neighbours in Austria, Servia, and
Turkey. He therefore at once consented to his
son's promotion, and generously was the first
in Montenegro to do homage to the young
Prince.
</p>

<p>
Up to the year 1850, when Prince Danielo
succeeded to the throne of Montenegro, the country
had always been ruled by a Prince-Bishop,
styled the Vladika. This dignitary, generally, if
not always, nominated his own successor in the
person of a nephew or some other near relative,
who, on the death of the Vladika at once took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
holy orders and became in his turn Prince-Bishop.
</p>

<p>
Danielo, not wishing to give up the happiness
of home and married life, and also perhaps with
the hope of founding a dynasty of his own in
Montenegro, which in the course of time might, by
extension and the absorption of other principalities,
become an important kingdom, repaired to St.
Petersburgh on the death of the Vladika Peter II.,
his uncle, and there obtained the full consent of
the Emperor Nicholas to his effecting a division
between Church and State. On his return journey
to Cettigne he married at Trieste the Princess
Darinka, hoping to have founded a line of princes
to succeed him. His hopes however were destined
to be blighted. Darinka had no children, and
after reigning eight years, he was murdered at
Cattaro as I have related above.
</p>

<p>
The young Prince, (Nicholas I.) who had
already been betrothed almost in infancy, as is
the custom among the upper classes in that
country to a relation of his own, daughter of one
of the principal Voyvodes in Montenegro, followed
his studies under special direction in the Palace
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
of his ancestors; till one day the late Emperor
Napoleon III., for reasons of his own, proposed to
have the young Prince sent to Paris, there to be
educated under his own eye; and the offer having
been accepted, a French man-of-war without loss
of time steamed into the Gulf of Cattaro and
carried away the young Prince, together with two
companions of his own age, sons of two of the
principal Voyvodes of the country. Whatever care
was bestowed upon the Prince's education, he
amply profited by it; he is an excellent French and
Italian, as well as German and Russian scholar.
He is exceptionally well informed, and on a great
variety of subjects; and voracious to a degree
for more information, especially concerning English
laws, customs, and manners, in all of which he
takes the greatest interest, and is most anxious
that Englishmen should visit his country. He was
good enough to have me repeatedly at his house
and at his hospitable board, and he never omitted to
repeat to me.
</p>

<p>
"I shall always be glad to see English gentlemen
in my country; tell them, when you go back,
that if they are fond of shooting, they shall have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
their choice of game, from an eagle to a blackbird,
and from a bear to a squirrel; if they prefer
fishing, I promise them trout such as they have
never dreamt of,<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> and they shall have every
assistance that I can afford them in the way
of tents to camp out, and men to guide and help
them."
</p>

<p>
In appearance, the Prince is tall and remarkably
handsome; his hair is black, he wears both beard
and moustachios, contrary to the fashion of his
country, where only the latter are worn, often of
immense size and length. With a commanding
appearance, he still has a most benevolent expression
of countenance, due to the softness of a very fine
pair of eyes, and his manners are most captivating.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
He is very dignified, but at the same
time most kind, without being in the least
patronizing, and I was told by those who knew
him best that he has a most equable temper,
and that an angry word seldom was heard from
him.
</p>

<p>
I had been careful before leaving the Palace
to set my watch exactly to their time, so as to
ensure my punctuality in the evening; and at
eight <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to the minute, I found myself in the
saloon of the Palace. The Russian Consul was
there already; he was showing me the different
portraits which hung round it, when the Prince
walked in, in full Montenegrin costume, but
without any ceremony; and a few minutes after
a door was thrown open from the opposite side,
when in walked the Princess, accompanied by the
widow of Prince Mirko and attended by her
lady-in-waiting, Mademoiselle Neukomm, all in
full native costume.
</p>

<p>
Pero Pejovich had so often extolled the beauty
of the Princess, that I was quite prepared to be
disappointed, as is almost always the case, for
anticipation seems invariably to exaggerate the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
reality; but on this occasion it was just the reverse.
I don't think I ever saw a more beautiful creature
than the lady to whom I was then introduced;
tall, pale, neither thin nor stout, but beautifully
formed, and with exquisite hands and arms. She
wore a diamond ornament on her head, half hidden
by the masses of black hair among which it was
nestled, and though it shone at times like a star
from among a mass of stormy clouds, it could
not subdue the light which shone from her glorious
dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was instantly announced, and we proceeded
to the dining-hall, a room of good size
and well-furnished. The dinner, a German one,
was good, the wines better. The attendance consisted
of two men in black and four in native
costume. The Princess, who speaks French fluently,
did the honours with most winning grace; and
the Prince, by his affability, at once put every
one at his ease. At dinner I sat on his left, his
mother being on his right, with the Russian
Consul <i>vis-à-vis</i>, principally, I suppose, to facilitate
her enjoyment of the conversation, as she
speaks only Slave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
During the repast His Highness constantly
asked me questions, sometimes about my impressions
of Montenegro, which were easily enough
answered, as I had nothing to recount of myself
but enjoyment since I had entered his territory,
having met with nothing but the most unbounded
kindness and hospitality. But in his anxiety for
knowledge, he often put questions which I found
it difficult enough to reply to, and sometimes
questions which I could not answer at all. Having
spoken with admiration of the gorgeous costume
of the Montenegrins, and how it set off their fine
figures, he replied:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is very fine; but I should be delighted
to abolish it, if it were possible; they spend a great
deal too much money on it."
</p>

<p>
Being simply horrified at the idea of doing
away with national dress, I could not avoid expressing
myself unreservedly, and I said at once
that depriving a country of its costume would be
simply to destroy it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" replied the Prince sharply, "you look
upon us only from a picturesque point of view;
in fact, you would like to keep us here like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
a sort of menagerie of wild beasts, to come
and look at us occasionally for your amusement."
</p>

<p>
The Prince was almost angry; but fortunately
I had an analogous example to place before him,
in our own Scottish Highlanders, who cling to
their costume with such tenacity. I told him of
our Highlanders, of our splendid Highland regiments,
of how our Scottish nobility held by the
national dress, and of how our precious Queen
dressed all her boys in Highland costume; and
yet we did not go to look at them as we would
go to look at wild beasts in a zoological garden,
but we regarded it with admiration, as an ancient
national costume, associated in our minds with
devoted loyalty, stirring times, and valiant deeds;
as their own costume was also, which, I trusted,
I should never live to see exchanged for a bad
imitation of the present universally adopted French
fashion, ending by saying that I was convinced
that the supplanting of national costumes with
imitations taken from our neighbours, was decidedly
a backward step in civilization.
</p>

<p>
He questioned me very closely upon the law of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
primogeniture and entail in our country, and could
not understand how such a law did not produce
<i><span lang="fr_FR">des jalousies terribles, et d'autres inconvenances</span></i>. I
endeavoured to explain to him the present law of
English entail, and how it differed from the ancient
Roman law of <i><span lang="la">fidéi-commis</span></i>, which still obtains in
Scotland, where entails are for ever. Still he did
not like our system of primogeniture, where the
eldest son, in many instances, has £100,000 per
annum, and all the other children £10,000 each,
representing about £400 a year. He thought it
terribly unfair; indeed he could not understand
how they quietly submitted to it at all; and so we
got through our dinner most agreeably without
the least <i><span lang="fr_FR">gêne</span></i>, while the Prince's band played some
excellent music outside, under the window. This
band consisted entirely of Montenegrin lads, some
quite young, and considering the short time they
had been learning their new profession, was wonderfully
good. The bandmaster was from Prague,
an excellent musician, and as he was a Czech,
he spoke a language very similar to Montenegrin,
which contributed not a little to his
success.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Having left the dining-room in company with
the ladies, we all adjourned to the saloon, and
from it to the terrace in front of the Palace, where
the Prince having lit a cigarette, offered some to
me and Mr. Yonin. As I hesitated to light mine,
after having taken one, the Princess, who immediately
guessed that my hesitation was owing to
her being present, at once most kindly came forward
and requested me to smoke "<i>de suite</i>" &amp;c.
I therefore lit my cigarette at once, saying with a
deep bow that I dared not disobey her commands.
She then bid me watch, as presently a change
would suddenly take place in the aspect of the
scene.
</p>

<p>
It was now quite dark, when suddenly a cannon
was fired, and simultaneously, as if by magic, every
window in the town, in the Palace opposite, in the
monastery, in the terrace, and at every point where
a candle could be stuck, was filled with lights, while
the band played the grand Russian National Hymn,
and the people shouted with all the power of their
lungs, firing off their pistols in the air in every
direction.
</p>

<p>
The illumination was so instantaneous that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
the effect was charming, and coupled with the
music, the enthusiastic cheering, and the booming
of the cannon, which kept up a sort of
"contrabasso" accompaniment to the whole, all
contributed to produce a <i><span lang="fr_FR">coup de scène</span></i> never to
be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
We now all withdrew to the drawing-room
for coffee and tea, <i><span lang="fr_FR">à la Russe</span></i>, without cream and
with a slice of lemon. I was not sorry to leave
the balcony, for that firing of pistols in the
air is not so innocent a pastime as might be
imagined, as no Montenegrin ever dreams of
loading his weapons with anything else than ball-cartridge.
</p>

<p>
The Prince again resumed his conversation with
me about English customs and manners. He
said, "I am told that in London one policeman,
unarmed, can control a mob, while in Paris it is
very different, as nothing short of loaded muskets
and bayonets will do for the French."
</p>

<p>
I answered him that English mobs could be
troublesome too, but that, generally speaking,
owing to our constitutional respect for the majesty
of the law, we came to look upon that solitary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
unarmed policeman as an impersonation of it, and
as such he was always sure of the active assistance
of all respectable citizens in the execution of his
duty.
</p>

<p>
He then began to question me about the British
constitution, and I never felt more posed. Irish
mother-wit, however, came to the rescue, and I
said, "To explain the British Constitution I should
have to be a lawyer, but one of the great characteristics
of it, so far as a layman like me can
explain it, consists in what is called the Law of
Habeas Corpus, by which no man can be imprisoned
by any authority whatever without being immediately
informed of the accusation against him, and
brought up before the constituted authorities within
twenty-four hours."
</p>

<p>
He said he had heard of that before, and thought
it a grand law, but under certain circumstances he
considered it might be advantageous for the king
to have the power of arresting dangerous characters,
upon which I told him that in certain emergencies
the law of Habeas Corpus had been suspended, but
that could only be done by Act of Parliament, and
not by the sovereign's authority.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"In short," said he, "your Chambers are the
real sovereign, the King being only the outward
and visible sign of regal authority."

<p class="drop-cap">
THE firing had now ceased, and the
illumination was fading out by degrees,
the band was still playing in
front of the Palace, and the full
moon was rising well up in the sky. The crowd
had increased, as we could see from the window of
the saloon, and the broad space in front of the
Palace was literally paved with heads and up-turned
faces. After looking a few minutes at that dense
mass which was swaying to and fro and gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
getting closer and closer, the Prince asked me
what I thought of their behaviour. "Most wonderfully
quiet, orderly, and well behaved; but I can't
help looking upon them all as so many powder
kegs. One cross word, an imaginary insult, a
little too much drink, one of a thousand trifling
incidents, might set a spark going, and it will
be wonderful indeed if among these thousands of
wild and lawless men some turmoil does not
arise, and when their Oriental blood is once up, and
arms are at hand and ready, blood will scarcely fail
to flow."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the Prince, "I venture to say there
won't be the smallest misadventure to-night, though
I haven't a policeman near here, and there are
probably twenty thousand armed men in and about
Cettigne at this moment. Do you think there are
many Sovereigns in Europe who could with safety
walk about in such a crowd in one of their
own capitals during a time of excitement such as
this?"
</p>

<p>
"Not one, I should think," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then," said he, "put on your hat and come
along with me."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I followed him into the lobby, where throwing a
scarf about his shoulders he bid me follow him,
first having told his henchman that he would go
out alone.
</p>

<p>
It was now about eleven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and in a few minutes
we were out shouldering our way in the thickest
of the crowd, making for the spot where the band
was playing. It was not long before he was
recognised, right and left, and now began one of
the most interesting scenes I ever witnessed.
Where there had been a crowd so dense that
progression seemed almost an impossibility, an ample
space was formed, and then one by one men of
all grades approached the Prince, and, according to
their rank and station, one and all saluted him in
the following way—they took off their caps, and
those of the lowest grades took up the edge of his
coat and "literally kissed the hem of his garment;"
then those of somewhat better position kissed
the same garment higher up; to others of higher
rank still, the Prince extended his hand, which they
kissed most reverently, and pressed to their foreheads
three times; and lastly the Chiefs and Voyvodes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
almost on an equality with him, doffed their
caps, while His Highness did the same, and both
holding each other's right hand pressed the side
of their cheek against each other. And so I
accompanied him, walking through that living mass,
stopping every moment either to receive some
act of homage, or to caress some bold little curly-headed
fellow who had squeezed and wriggled
himself in to get near to his Prince, and to
whom His Highness would speak a few words,
asking his name and age, and where he went to
school, and what he could do, to the untold pride
and joy of the parents who were watching. And
so we shortly made the tour of the town, coming
out on the plain right in front of the monastery
where many groups were busily engaged in the
performance of the national dance.
</p>

<p>
The lights had now gone out, and the illumination
had faded away, but the moon nearly at the
full was high up in the heavens, and shining as it
does not, alas! shine in these islands. The band was
gone, and the only music to be heard was the native
<i>guzla</i>, accompanied by the monotonous chaunt of
the vocalists, interrupted occasionally by the wild
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
piercing shriek of some dancer. The Prince made
for one of the groups where apparently the
dancing was most energetic, whilst I followed
close on his heels. Being at once recognised,
ample way was made for him, and I soon found
myself alongside of him in the innermost circle of
the ring.
</p>

<p>
Here I had full opportunity of observing the
native Montenegrin dance, which, if not elegant,
has certainly the merit of originality. How shall
I describe it? In the area of that ring in which
we found ourselves were five couple of dancers,
who were being constantly renewed, men and
women, as either became exhausted by their exertions.
The dance itself did not seem to consist
of any peculiar steps, but mainly in jumping with
the arms extended horizontally, leaping as high
as each one could opposite the other, and twirling
round at the same time like dancing dervishes,
whilst occasionally, as either man or woman had
to give in from sheer exhaustion, they uttered a
piercing shriek. Though somewhat savage and
uncouth to behold, there still was a weird charm
about that dance. The tall mountaineers looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
taller still from their long white surtouts in the
bright moonlight, and as they sprang high into the air
they appeared absolutely gigantic, while the glitter
of the moon's rays on the metallic ornaments of
their dress and their jewelled arms produced a
strange and pleasing effect. From one group the
Prince passed on to another, and so through all till
about one in the morning, when he turned his steps
towards the Palace,
</p>

<p>
"Our dance is not an elegant one," said the
Prince, "but it is characteristic; it is called the
Dance of the Eagles, and its origin is thus accounted
for. Many years ago the Montenegrins had no
national dance, when some of the young men said,
'How is it all our neighbours have national dances
of their own and we have none? Let us imagine
and invent a dance; and, as our mountains are the
country of the eagles, let us make it like eagles
rising from the rocks, and let us scream like the
young eagles.' And so they stretched out their
arms and sprang into the air as high as they could,
dancing their Eagle Dance, which from thenceforth
became the national dance of the country."
</p>

<p>
At the gates of the Palace I made my bow, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
the Prince, putting out his hand, wished me good
night, saying, "I must see you again before you
leave."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes I was in my room. I required
no light, the moon was so brilliant. The night
being warm, and not feeling at all sleepy from the
excitement I had gone through, I lit a cigar, and
leaning with my elbows on the window-sill, I looked
out into the little plain where so shortly before I
had been walking about. The turmoil had now
greatly diminished, and in every direction I could
see that preparations were being made to bivouac
<i><span lang="fr_FR">à la belle étoile</span></i>. The horses that up to this time had
been allowed to roam about here and there, cropping
the scanty herbage, were now being collected and
picketed one by one near the spot which had been
selected by the owner for his own peculiar sleeping
place; while the court-yard of the old Palace was
also fully tenanted, and apparently by the same
party I had watched in the early morning, and
which, from the better style of their horses, the
glitter of their equipments, and the appearance of
their attendants, seemed to belong to some of
the native chiefs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
</p>

<p>
By degrees the different noises ceased, and in
less than an hour the whole camp was steeped in
silence. Such a contrast to the noise and turmoil
of an hour before, when twenty thousand people,
men, women and children, were shouting, dancing,
and yelling at the top of their voices!
</p>

<p>
I put on my helmet, and with a short stick in
my hand, simply to keep away any snarling dog
that might be inclined to give trouble, I quickly
crossed the court-yard and let myself out by the
gate into the plain. The moon had barely passed
the zenith, and shone almost perpendicularly on
the prostrate groups, who, in different attitudes of
sleep, were dotted all about; some wrapped up
in their strookas, more from habit than necessity,
as the air was warm; some turned on their faces,
some on their back with their arms outstretched;
but all profoundly asleep; and such was the
silence that, but for the absence of blood and
mutilated limbs and broken weapons, one could
easily have imagined it the field of some hard-fought
fight.
</p>

<p>
I was surveying the placid scene and standing
close to a magnificent mountaineer who was sleeping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
on his back, with his face fully upturned to the
moon and his arms extended, when suddenly he
awoke. In the twinkling of an eye he was on his
feet and his hand on his yataghan. I don't
imagine my life was the least in danger, even for
a moment—but if it was, my helmet and my cigar
saved me. However, I instantly saluted him in
Slave, and with a "<i>Sbogo Gospodin</i>" he returned
the compliment, at the same time putting out his
hand he shook mine warmly, and pointing with
the other to the ancient Palace, led me away
towards it, talking softly the while and smiling;
but unfortunately I could not understand, and the
only response I could make was by offering him
a cigar, which he at once lit at mine and pronouncing
it "<i>dobre</i>" (good) puffed away at it
with a will. At the great gate of the Palace he
wished me good-night, when I begged of him by
signs to take another weed, and so we parted.
</p>

<p>
The next morning being the day of the feast,
I was awoke pretty early by the repeated firing
of cannon just outside the gate of the Palace and
in front of my window. I should have been
glad to have slept a few hours longer, but the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
noise was too great, and my so-called Italian-speaking
servant coming in at the same moment,
I jumped out of bed and called out,
"<i><span lang="it_IT">Colazione</span>!</i>"
</p>

<p>
I had not more than half finished, and was
in the act of peeling some grand specimens of
Albanian figs, when in walked Pero Pejovich,
who came to tell me that the Prince and Princess,
with all the notables and Voyvodes of Montenegro,
would attend High Mass at ten, and that the
<i><span lang="fr_FR">cortège</span></i> would pass under my windows and would
be worth seeing. He added that if I liked he
would take me into church and get me standing-room
inside before they arrived; but he feared
the crowd and the heat would be something fearful.
Consequently, finding it quite hot enough
already, I determined to remain where I was
and enjoy the procession from my window.
</p>

<p>
I then told the Commandant of my adventure
the night before. He scolded me awfully, but
patted me on the back, as one would a child,
and said I might have run some risk had I
not been fortunately recognised as a guest of the
Prince.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Only imagine," said he, "if anything had gone
wrong, the honour of Montenegro might have been
compromised."
</p>

<p>
We then lit our cigars, and while waiting for
mass-time, fell, as usual, into conversation about his
country and its usages.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of our Prince, and the
way he goes among the people? I saw you last
night with him. Did you ever see such love,
such devotion, as we all have for him? But he
deserves it fully. There never was such a ruler
as our Prince; we would all lay down our lives
for him, and be proud of the honour. If he were
to call us to arms, we could muster in twelve hours,
here in this plain of Cettigne, twenty thousand
able men, fully armed and equipped, ready to march
on any point, and that without endangering Montenegro;
for we should leave twenty thousand more
behind us, not so well adapted for advancing in
an enemy's country, but fully competent to guard
our mountain passes and protect our strongholds."
</p>

<p>
I said I hoped such a contingency might never
arise; but he shook his head. The Turks, he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
hated them too much not to seek, sooner or
later, for a pretext to attack them, and then he
added,
</p>

<p>
"But the sooner the better; we never were so
well prepared to meet them. The Turks pretend
that Montenegro is an integral portion of the
Ottoman Empire; we insist that we have always
been free, and though often hard pressed by Ottoman
forces, have never yet been conquered. What
chance then is there of our coming to an understanding?
My great grief, however, is to hear
that England is against us and in favour of our
enemies, and if it were not for the friendship which
Russia has ever shown us, we might be exterminated
by the infidels before you would lift a finger to
prevent our utter annihilation. We cannot understand
it, for we read of how England exerts herself
always in favour of oppressed nationalities, and
how she has even spent hundreds of millions of
piastres to put down the slave trade; and yet she
favours the Turks, who are the greatest supporters
of slavery, against us, though our
religions are almost identical, I am told.
I wish more English would come to Montenegro.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
I think they would end by appreciating
us."
</p>

<p>
These words of the Commandant made a deep
impression on me.

TRULY very little is known about
Montenegro and its mountaineers,
and that little is very incorrect.
They have been generally represented
as wild, savage, bloodthirsty, thieving scoundrels,
closely allied to Italian brigands and Greek palikari—if
anything, worse than either. Fond of
fighting for fighting's sake, and when not engaged
in that amiable recreation, spending their time in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
strutting about in their fine clothes, peacocking
in the sunshine, while those too poor to have
fine trappings whiled away the weary hours and
forgot their fleas and their sorrows in the tones
of their national <i>guzla</i>, while the women were left
to do all the labour in the fields.
</p>

<p>
Such was certainly not my impression. The
part of Montenegro through which I travelled,
though sterile and barren to a degree, was a wonderful
specimen of what man could do when driven
to it. Every little nook, where the least bit of
soil could be found, among that wilderness of rocks
where stones had rained from Heaven, was carefully
taken advantage of; the rocks adjoining these
little nooks were often removed by the most
laborious exertions, and in some instances earth
was scraped up here and there, and carried in small
baskets to these spots, in order to increase their
depth of soil. I saw clearings of so small a
size as barely to admit of <i>one potatoe plant</i> or
three of maize, and little fields not <i>one yard</i> in
diameter!
</p>

<p>
Hard at work, cultivating the soil, I saw not
only women but plenty of sturdy mountaineers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
At Niegosh I observed one of the Petrovichs, the
handsome young fellow who entertained me on my
way to Cettigne, superintending himself a number
of men who were working in a field near his house;
and the only difference I could observe between
them and our own labourers was that they were
all fully armed, although employed at the peaceful
occupation of agriculture. They have not yet
turned their yataghans into spades and reaping
hooks, but they have done the next best thing by
keeping the first at ease while energetically plying
the others.
</p>

<p>
I have seen the Montenegrins in their own
valleys and mountain fastnesses, and I utterly deny
the charges brought against them. They are not
lazy—leaving all the hard work to their women—that
is utterly false, and the best proof I perhaps
can give, lies in the self-asserting fact of the
toiling colony of three thousand Montenegrin
Facchini at Constantinople, well known as about
the most hard-working and honest labouring men
in that capital. It is true that they allow the
women to do much of the heavy agricultural work,
and carry heavy loads up and down the mountains;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
but it must be remembered that for years past
the Montenegrins, like the proscribed clans of
Scotland in the last century, have been treated by
their neighbours, the Turks, very little better than
wild beasts. They would long ago have been
exterminated, but for their indomitable courage and
constant fighting, during which period, of necessity,
the agricultural duties fell entirely on the decrepit
old men and the women, as all men who were at
all able to carry arms were engaged in fighting—and
many of the women too! It must also be
remembered that in all mountainous countries
the women toil more heavily than in the plains,
and even in civilized Italy hear what a distinguished
Italian, Massimo d'Azeglio, writes:
</p>

<p>
"For example, if a faggot of wood and a bunch
of chickens have to be carried down to the shore
from one of the villages half way up the mountain,
the labour is thus distributed in the family. The
wife loads herself with the faggot of wood which
weighs half a hundredweight, and the husband will
take the chickens which weigh a mere nothing."
The Montenegrins are not, therefore, singularly
and atrociously barbarous in this respect.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Considering the small extent of the Principality
and its great sterility, it is wonderful the amount
of produce they are able to export, even with the disabilities
under which they labour, being entirely deprived
of any seaboard, though clearly entitled to one.
One of the most important of their natural products,
one which under favourable circumstances might
be increased a thousandfold is "sumach," a substance
largely used in tanning the more expensive
kinds of leather. A small amount is exported to
Holland, none comes to England, but a small
parcel I brought over with me was declared by
competent judges to be equal to the best
Sicilian, which is considered the best of all
sumachs.
</p>

<p>
They have vast forests of walnut trees which,
under proper management and due facilities of
exportation, might be rendered most productive,
both as to walnut oil and timber for
cabinet work. They export immense quantities
of a small dried fish "<i><span lang="it_IT">scoranza</span></i>," much used
in the neighbouring Catholic and Greek countries
during their religious feasts; and without
further wearying my readers, I will simply
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
add that but for the difficulties they labour
under, they could export every one of the following
articles in very considerable quantities:—
</p>

<p>
Castradina (dried mutton and goat hams), honey,
wax, goat and kid skins to any amount, as
also martin, fox, and hare skins, together
with many other substances I have forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The Prince is doing all he can to spread
instruction among his people. He has established
numberless schools, and as all over the Principality
education is compulsory, in another generation
the man or woman unable to read
and write will be a phenomenon indeed in Montenegro.
</p>

<p>
The renewed booming of the cannon and the
ringing of the convent bells now gave us warning
that the Prince was going to hear Mass, and in
a few seconds I saw the whole <i>cortège</i> pass on foot
under my window. First a squad of guards, then
His Highness the Prince leading the beautiful
Princess, immediately accompanied by the Russian
Consul in full uniform, and then a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
Voyvodes in gorgeous costumes, while another
squad of body-guards brought up the rear. They
walked quickly past, and in a few minutes were
lost completely to sight under the buttresses of the
old Palace. The pageant was of short duration,
but it was well worth seeing, even in that land of
sunshine and gorgeous costumes.
</p>

<p>
Mass over, everyone turned in for his
dinner and siesta. The Commandant of the
Grahovo went to his own abode, and I followed the
general example.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon some wonderful foot races were
to be held, but not till near sunset, when the great
heat of the day would be somewhat abated. I
determined therefore to fill up the space between
the end of my siesta and the visit to the races,
with a call on Monsignor Roganovich, the
Metropolitan of Montenegro. I had brought
letters of recommendation to the Archimandrite of
Cettigne, and in his company I went to the
monastery to pay my respects. We entered by the
great gate, after crossing the threshing floor, and
having crossed the court we ascended by a
very rough stone staircase, which landed us in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
sort of primitive cloister looking on a garden, on
which opened the suite of rooms occupied by the
Metropolitan.
</p>

<p>
We were at once shown in, and had not to
wait many seconds before Monsignor Roganovich
made his appearance. His reception was most
cordial. He took me by the hand and made me
sit on the divan by his side, expressing his regret
that he could not converse with me except through
an interpreter, owing to his not speaking any
other language than Illyrian and Russian. We got
on, however, remarkably well, thanks to the
rapidity with which the Archimandrite almost
guessed what I was going to say in Italian,
translating it into Illyrian with equal rapidity.
Coffee, as usual, was served up, unaccompanied
however by the customary pipes, as the orthodox
clergy are forbidden to smoke.
</p>

<p>
And now as I am sipping my coffee, let me
endeavour to describe what I saw as my eyes
wandered about. The room itself was small and
low, simply white-washed, with no other furniture
than one small table in front of the divan, and
four rush chairs of the homeliest description.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
Around the walls were a few coloured prints of
saints, and the floor was utterly uncarpeted. All
this simplicity, however, served to bring out in
greater contrast and relief the portly figure of
Monsignor Roganovich, as he sat on the divan
in his ample cassock and gown of violet-purple
silk. He was not a handsome man, strictly
speaking, his was more a jolly countenance than
a handsome one, still it was a face one liked to
look at, with his grand black beard flowing
down to his waist. He wore his hair in ample
curls down his back as if it had never known
the shears, and on his head the little Montenegrin
cap of black silk. On his breast glittered the
star of the Montenegrin order, and round his
neck a massive gold chain, from which depended
a Panagia or image of the Virgin and Child, nearly
as large as a saucer, surrounded with large
diamonds.
</p>

<p>
His manners were courtly and his smile most
pleasing, and he gave me the idea of one who
would make an excellent companion for a little
dinner party of four, and who would be more in
his element on the Boulevard des Italiens at Paris,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
than in his monastic seclusion at Cettigne. We
conversed for half an hour or so when I rose
to take my leave, and he gave me the
Apostolic Benediction, and embraced me on both
cheeks. As we walked back to the Palace, the
Archimandrite told me he took great interest
in the schools, which he visited daily, examining
and cross-examining the students, to
see that they made good use of their
time.

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
IN the afternoon I went out into the
plain to see the foot races, which
the Prince had told me would be very
amusing.
</p>

<p>
On my way to the plain, where the races were
to take place, I rambled again through the fair, and
a second time got into conversation with the fellow
that spoke English so well. We chatted together
on many subjects, all more or less connected with
the country; he praised the Montenegrins to no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
end, and told me he would trust them to any
amount, they were so thoroughly honest and
scrupulous in their dealings. He wanted me
to go with him, in a couple of days after
the fair was over, to the monastery of
Ostrog, but my time was not my own, and I
could not give myself that additional pleasure.
</p>

<p>
It was a great disappointment, however, as Ostrog
is a wonderful place, cut out of the rock, not
perched on one as some of the monasteries of
Mount Athos are, but partly excavated at a great
height out of the face of the rock, and partly
built on a ledge which the upper part of the
rock overhangs. It is approached by a narrow
path cut into steps, where no more than two
could walk abreast, and therefore easily defended by
a handful of men against any number of assailants.
There is an ample supply of water in it at all
times, and it is always stored with a good supply of
rations, and an immense quantity of ammunition.
Except by starving out the garrison, it never could
be taken.
</p>

<p>
My companion wanted me then to go with him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
into the interior of Northern Albania, where he was
well known, and where under his protection and
guidance I should have been perfectly safe; while
his knowledge of the languages, both Oriental and
English, would have enabled me to make many
interesting inquiries. When I asked him about
the administration of those countries by the
Ottoman Government, and the opening up of the
country by the projected railway from Adrianople
to Novi-Bazar which has already been surveyed,
he shrugged his shoulders, and then, with a toss of
his head, said:—
</p>

<p>
"Railways are all very good, but they are
almost useless here. What we want is a good
Government, and that we never shall have as long
as this Christian country is ruled by the Turks.
You talk of the progress of civilization among
them; but you simply know nothing about them.
I can speak, for I have lived with them and among
them from childhood; and as to their civilization,
it is simply a farce. Even at Stamboul, among the
better educated, among those who have been to
Paris and London, their civilization is nothing
more than the gilding of Brummagem jewelry—the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
slightest rubbing will cause the copper to
blush out from beneath. Civilization indeed!
See what a powerful navy they possess; but let
Hobart Pasha go home and take with him all
his European officers, men and engineers, leaving
nothing behind but pure full-blooded Turks to
man it, and the entire Ottoman navy would not
be a match for the smallest British ironclad. In
making this disparaging statement as to the so-called
civilization of Turkey, I have selected the
navy as an example because in old times the Turks
were able to hold their own at sea, and showed
a great aptitude in naval matters; but naval science
has progressed and they have remained stationary.
But so it is—their civilization is a dream; their
finances a colossal sham; and their final exodus
from Europe, I trust, is in the very nearest
distance. In fact, if all the Christians in Ottoman
employ—English, French, Armenian or Greek—were
to abandon their several posts, Turkey
would simply collapse in six months."
</p>

<p>
I don't say that these are my opinions, but
simply the clearly expressed convictions of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
sharp trader who had long been intimate with
European Turkey.
</p>

<p>
It wanted not much more than an hour of
sunset; the western crags threw long purple
shadows along the plain of Cettigne, while the
rocks which bound it on the east were steeped in
the richest tints of gold, and russet, and purple.
Up, near to the old Palace of the Vladikas, was
a splendid group of native magnates with the
Prince in the midst, while ranged in a row before
them were about a hundred and fifty of the most
athletic men in Montenegro—competitors all in a
coming foot race for a splendid pair of silver-mounted
pistols, offered by His Highness to him
who should first lay his hands on them. The
pistols were placed on a conspicuous rock a
considerable way up the cliffs on the south-west
side of the plain.
</p>

<p>
The competitors may have been placed at a
distance of three hundred yards from the base of
those cliffs; it was, therefore, partly a flat race
and partly a "<i><span lang="fr_FR">course à la montagne</span></i>:" as the
Prince said, "<i><span lang="fr_FR">En Angleterre vous avez les courses
au clocher</span></i>, (steeple-chases) <i><span lang="fr_FR">ici nous avons les courses à la montagne</span></i>."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
The men had divested themselves
of their white coats, and their belts and
armour. For an instant there was profound silence,
and then, at a given signal, off they went at a
good pace, keeping wonderfully together for the
first two hundred yards or so; then the line began
to get wavy, and with every stride more and
more fell behind, till, when they arrived at the
foot of the crags, there were not, perhaps, more
than fifty that sprang up simultaneously to the
cliffs. Then, indeed, began the real race, and
the mountaineers took to it in right earnest,
scaling the precipice like leopards. It was quite
exciting to watch the rapidity with which they
swung themselves from point to point, taking
advantage of every cleft, every rootlet, that
offered the least hold to either hand or foot.
At last, three arrived almost simultaneously at
the goal; but one, slightly in advance, made a
vigorous spring—touched the pistols first—barely
winning by a hand!
</p>

<p>
It was, without exception, the prettiest thing
by way of a race I ever saw. The whole scene
was before you like a panorama; the costumes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
of the runners and the spectators; the gorgeous
tints of the setting sun; the enthusiasm of all,
together with the shouts of the multitude, rendered
it a scene never to be forgotten; and as I watched
them clambering up the cliffs in front of me,
guessing at the chances of the race, and mentally
gambling with myself on who would be the winner,
I could not help feeling a certain degree of surprise
that no betting was going on in any part of that
vast assemblage. The chances were so many, the
combinations so varied, and the probabilities so
constantly changing, that a fairer game to try the
luck of Dame Fortune could not have been
devised, and all the more, too, as all were honestly
in earnest in striving for the prize. There were
no dark horses, no sickened favourites, no hard-pulling
jockeys to bewilder the backers; all was
before you, fair and serene, and the excitement
was tremendous when some one fine mountaineer,
well in advance of the rest, maybe by five or
six yards, would suddenly lose his foothold through
the giving way of some small projection of rock
to which, he was clinging, and after remaining
suspended a short time by his hands above his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
head, he would eventually have to let go his hold
and drop down some few feet, losing all chance
in the race; while those who had been nearest to
him would redouble their efforts, and thus at
times the one who at first starting had seemed
the least likely to win would actually come to
be in the first flight of the race; but he, in
his turn, by some unlucky chance would slip,
and another would as instantly get on before
him. These constant changes of chances made
the race a most exciting one; still not a bet among
the multitude of lookers-on!
</p>

<p>
One of the Prince's aide-de-camps having heard
me express surprise at the absence of all betting,
said, "Betting is quite a characteristic of you others
(<i><span lang="fr_FR">vous autres</span></i>) in England. I am told you would
bet on anything. I have heard a story of a poor
girl who once threw herself off a bridge in
London. The police-boat, fortunately, was near,
and pulled away to her rescue, when two lords
happening to pass by, stopped on the bridge for a
bet as to whether the girl would be saved or
not, and lost and won an immense sum on the
event."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I laughed, and replied,
</p>

<p>
"<i><span lang="it_IT">Se non è vero è ben trovato</span>.</i>"
</p>

<p>
After this we had a flat race for about a mile
across the plains. So far as running went, it
was a <i>flat</i> race indeed, and I have often seen better
at an Irish country fair; but it was well worth
seeing from the rich colouring of the costumes
of those taking part in it, as they ran with their
clothes on; and as every one was eligible to compete,
and not Montenegrins alone, the effect was
most singular and picturesque. The prize was
in this case also a pair of silver-mounted Turkish
pistols, given by the Prince, and I was
glad to hear that the winner was a Montenegrin.
</p>

<p>
In the evening I had the honour of dining at
the Palace, when the Prince again asked me
many questions concerning England, its habits
and customs, of which, although he had read
much in French books, he knew absolutely nothing.
</p>

<p>
We again spoke about the law of primogeniture,
about which he could not exactly make up
his mind, and could not understand how it did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
not produce disastrous occurrences in families.
He understood, however, quite well what I explained
to him concerning the Law of Habeas
Corpus, and again declared it to be a grand institution,
<i>so far as the people were concerned</i>.
</p>

<p>
I left at a late hour, after spending a most
delightful evening, and as I went back to my
rooms to pack my small valise for my early start
next morning, I felt an undefinable regret at
leaving Tchernagora and its interesting mountaineers.
I had enjoyed among them a courteous
hospitality and a patriarchal welcome, the prominent
characteristics of which will, I fear, before
very long disappear under the pressure and <i><span lang="la">vis
a tergo</span></i> of our so-called European civilization. I
should like, above all things, to visit them again;
but should it never be my lot to enjoy that
pleasure, I cannot take leave of Montenegro
without expressing my deep sense of the cordial
reception I met with there on every side.

<p class="drop-cap">
AS the clock struck three in the morning
of the 15th of July, 1873, the
guide walked into my room to say
it was time to start; at the same
moment my servant brought me in a cup of
<i><span lang="fr_FR">café-au-lait</span></i> with some hot toast. My toilette was
soon made, and my breakfast swallowed, and I
moved away from Cettigne as the clock chimed the
half-hour after three.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was still night, but not dark, as the moon
had not yet set, and a band of rose-coloured light
streaked the Eastern horizon. We started at a
rapid trot, startling the echoes up the solitary and
deserted street of Cettigne, and we never slackened
our pace till we came to the verge of the little
plain in which it is situated, when the path up the
ravine which led westward to the Adriatic became
so rugged that we were compelled to walk our
horses, and in less than half-an-hour more had
to dismount and proceed on foot.
</p>

<p>
In a short time we reached the crest of the
range which encircles the Plains of Cettigne, and
the track becoming less precipitous, we remounted;
but before leaving the spot I turned my horse
round to have a last look at that mountain capital
where I had been so hospitably entertained, and
where, most probably, I might never have the
pleasure of being again.
</p>

<p>
I was now standing on the highest point of
the pass, and I enjoyed a most delightful view.
The sun was just in the act of rising. My back
was to the Adriatic, while my face was turned
to the East. At my feet lay the Plain of Cettigne,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
girt round on all sides with precipitous rocks and
mountains. Beyond the plain, far in the hazy
horizon—not foggy—but rendered slightly indistinct
by a faint cobalt haze, I could see the Lake
of Skodra glittering in the morning sun with
the thin silver streak of the Zeta river losing itself
in it, while in the still further distance I could
perceive the faintest outline of the Albanian mountains.
Right and left, as far as the eye could reach,
nothing but rocky peaks and precipices met the
view—nothing but rocks with here and there a few
scanty bushes, on which were browsing large herds
of goats tended by wild-looking men, carrying
round their waist, as usual, the inevitable arsenal
of weapons, and the long Albanian gun over their
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
I would have lingered over this scene, and I
was already thinking of getting down and sketching
it, when the guide remonstrated against any such
proceeding on my part. "It was very near the dog
days," he said, "and to be caught by the noon-day
sun on those bare rocks, was a thing to be avoided;"
so I was compelled to move on, after giving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
another long look at the picture to which I was
about to turn my back.
</p>

<p>
The guide was right; the track was abominable,
and we could only proceed at a slow pace. At the
same time, the sun was gaining strength with
every inch it rose above the horizon, and by
the time we reached the <i>clachan</i> of Niegosh, its
rays come down upon us like molten lead; but
my old helmet was proof against them, and an
excellent protection, while the faint breeze which
came up from the Adriatic prevented all feeling of
oppression.
</p>

<p>
At Niegosh, where a week before I had
been so kindly entertained by young Pejovich,
we rested five minutes. I did not even dismount,
but the guide went into the very primitive khan
to light his pipe; but, by the way he smacked his
lips on coming out, I suspect a glass of wodky
was not forgotten, while the fire for his pipe
was being handed to him.
</p>

<p>
After a little, the path again became impracticable
for riding, so I had to dismount and
walk, though the heat was something marvellous
(I afterwards heard from Signor Jackschich that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
in Cattaro, in the shade, the thermometer
stood at 33° Reaumur at four o'clock in the
afternoon—about 105° Fahrenheit.) After some
difficult scrambling, when I sorely felt the want
of the stout arm of Pero Pejovich, we reached
the fountain, and here we rested ten minutes;
then having remounted, we soon arrived at the
top of the <i>scala</i>, with the Adriatic before us and
Cattaro hundreds of feet down below.
</p>

<p>
It seemed now as if I should be at the end of
my journey in a few minutes; the road was all
before me, and I could count the zig-zags as they
unfolded themselves on the face of the rock,
still they seemed as if they would never come to
an end. I counted one, two, three, twenty, thirty,
fifty, up to one hundred bends, and still more
appeared beneath me, so at last I gave it up
through sheer exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Everything, however, has an end eventually,
and so the apparently interminable Scala di
Cattaro came to an end also. How I got on
during the last few turns and twists I forget—I
was in a sort of doze; all I remember is
finding myself suddenly among those heavenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
mulberry trees of the Esplanade, and hearing
the friendly sound of Signor Jackschich's
welcome.
</p>

<p>
Cattaro is innocent of either inn, hotel,
khan, or caravansary, but good accommodation
had been prepared for me inside the
town. I therefore rode on to the gate where I
had to dismount, as no horse is allowed to enter,
just as no carriage <i>can enter</i> the narrow gateway.
</p>

<p>
The Bocchesi (as the natives call themselves)
have one cause of heart-burning and envy,
less than we in our country; there are
no carriage-people in Cattaro to look down
upon <i>you</i> who have to trudge on foot,
and the nearest approach to anything of the
sort is an antique sedan-chair mounted on wheels
exactly like the celebrated old <i>push</i> at Hampton
Court, which was occasionally brought into requisition
on gala days, when such happened to be
wet ones also.
</p>

<p>
Having reached my rooms I quickly made
my toilet, and then returned to the mulberries,
under whose welcome shade I made an excellent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
breakfast and lunch in one, while many of the
natives were taking their dinner.
</p>

<p>
My further steps became now somewhat uncertain.
I thought I should have found the
steamer here to take me down the Adriatic,
but I had miscalculated; it was not due till the
following day. So I determined on resting in
Cattaro till evening, and then riding across the
isthmus (about eighteen miles only) to Budua,
where Baron von Heydeg was quartered, and
picking up the steamer when it would call there
in a couple of days. I at once telegraphed to
Heydeg that I was going, in order that the officer
on guard might open the gates for me on
arrival, as no one is let in or out of Budua
after sunset, without an order from the Commandant.
Then I went to my room, and
being fairly tired, I threw myself on the bed and
slept.
</p>

<p>
It was about half-past three when I was awoke
by some one knocking at my door, and to my
surprise, in walked Mr. Yonin, the Russian Consul.
I had forgotten to mention that we had agreed
to travel from Cettigne together, and were to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
have met in the street opposite the Palace at
three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; but the servants had forgotten to call
him, and when after waiting half an hour he did
not come, and the guards on duty would not allow
my guide to knock at the Palace gate, I started
without him, thinking he had changed his mind.
He had breakfasted late and then ridden to Cattaro
in the middle of the day in order to catch the
steamer for Ragusa that was to leave the same
evening. I told him how long I had waited, and
how I had tried in vain to get the sentinels to allow
us to knock. He could only lament his misfortune,
as, mopping his face, he added, "I
assure you the heat on those bare rocks was something
to be remembered all one's life." We then
arranged to dine together at five o'clock before
parting.
</p>

<p>
Punctual to the hour appointed, we met on
the <i>marina</i>. The heat of the day had considerably
diminished, for although the sun was still
high in the horizon, it had long ago set for
the good folks at Cattaro, as the city being
built at the foot of the mountains looking to
the West, and having a range of high cliffs in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
front of it, behind which the sun sinks long before
it dips into the Adriatic, sunset at Cattaro occurs
hours earlier than at any other place on the
Adriatic. In Summer this is a great advantage, as
it enables the inhabitants to walk out in the
shade on the <i>marina</i> at a much earlier hour, the
opposite cliffs protecting them from the hot rays
of the sun, and at the same time affording them a
sort of twilight, elsewhere unknown in those
latitudes; but in Winter it must be very gloomy,
as the rising sun being shut out by the rocks
and mountains of Montenegro till near eleven
o'clock in the morning, and again disappearing so
early in the afternoon, reduces the actual day
to as short a space as in the latitude of St.
Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
Availing themselves of the comparative coolness
of the hour, the <i>beau monde</i> of that primitive
little place, among which the Bishop and the
Commandant of the garrison were conspicuous,
had turned out for their evening promenade, and
the esplanade presented quite a gay appearance. I
ordered the horses for seven o'clock, and then we
went to look for our dinner at the café; but here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
something of a difficulty arose. The Bocchesi
dine at twelve noon, or at one at latest, and sup
at nine, no one ever thinking of a meal at five!
so that nothing was ready. The cook, however,
was equal to the emergency, and in fifteen minutes
served us up a most excellent and varied dinner,
to which we were about to sit down and do
ample justice, when who should turn up but
Pero Pejovich!
</p>

<p>
He was returning to his post in the Grahovo,
and found it easier to get to it by coming round
to Cattaro first, then going by sea to Risano and
thence, as it were, coming back on his own
steps, thus going a round of something like four
times the direct distance. This will convey some
idea of the difficulties to be encountered in endeavouring
to cross some of the rocky regions of
Montenegro.
</p>

<p>
I was delighted at seeing him again; we all
dined together, and enjoyed ourselves immensely
notwithstanding the heat. After dinner, Pero
Pejovich pulled out from among the ample folds
of his sash some Trebigne tobacco, which had
never seen the countenance of a Custom House
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
officer, and we set to work to make cigarettes,
when we were joined by Signor Jackschich and
Signor Radanovich, the Prince's Agent at Cattaro.
Coffee and maraschino were brought out, fresh
relays of cigarettes were manufactured, and we
could have enjoyed ourselves for hours more,
but the inexorable bell of the steamer rang out
a summons that bade Mr. Yonin prepare for
departure, while the increasing darkness served
to remind myself that I had yet a journey
before me ere I should be able to lie down to
rest.
</p>

<p>
We stood up reluctantly, and in a body accompanied
the Russian Consul to the steamer, and
there bade him adieu, probably for ever; though
who can tell? I have had at times the most
unexpected <i><span lang="fr_FR">rencontres</span></i> in the most unlikely places.
I first met him at Ragusa, where also I made
my first acquaintance with Mr. Paton, now unfortunately
no more; both very able and highly
educated men, yet they seemed not to appreciate
each other as they might have done, perhaps
from the diametrical opposition of their political
views.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Poor Paton is lost to us for ever, and we shall
never have a better member of our Consular service;
a shrewd, sagacious man, and a first-rate
Oriental scholar.
</p>

<p>
As to Mr. Yonin, I trust I may yet meet him,
and renew some of the pleasant hours I spent with
him.

THE twilight of Cattaro was fast
merging into darkness when I returned
with my companions to the
esplanade, where my horses were
ready to take me on to Budua. Our adieux were
short but cordial, and in a few minutes I was
cantering away in company with Signor Jackschich,
who lives in a villa a couple of miles away from
Cattaro.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If the tracks and paths of Montenegro are
rugged and wild, the beautiful road we were now
travelling on made ample amends for the discomfort
I had endured in riding during the last
few days. As we passed Signor Jackschich's villa,
I insisted on his remaining there, or his courtesy
would have induced him to keep me company ever
so much further on; so wishing him adieu for
the twentieth time, I lit my cigar, and sticking
spurs into my pony, cantered away on my road
to Budua. The ride was not interesting. I started
too late; I should have remembered that in those
latitudes, except at Cattaro, there is no twilight.
</p>

<p>
On leaving Cattaro the road is at first directly
south, leading across the isthmus of the peninsula
which forms the western shore of the gulf
of that name. Having reached the sea, it continues
to skirt the Adriatic, except in those places
where to avoid rounding a headland it runs
inland straight across the base of the promontory.
</p>

<p>
The night was fine, and we got on famously,
but whether in consequence of the good dinner,
or the genial sensation produced by the atmosphere,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
or the early hour I had risen in the morning,
when it came to be about eleven o'clock an indescribable
feeling of lassitude and intense sleepiness
came over me. I would have given anything
to lie down even for half-an-hour; but it was out
of the question, as we were at that time crossing
a sort of marsh, and there was not a dry spot
to lie down on. So I was compelled to ride on;
but I suspect I dozed, and then during those
moments of extreme lassitude and prostration, when
my vital powers were standing at their lowest, I
fear I imbibed some of those zymotic germs,
some malarious molecules, which a few days later
manifested themselves by a smart attack of fever.
Thanks, however, to a good constitution and a few
doses of quinine, I was able to cut it short in three
days, though it stuck to me for a little while
longer in the shape of an indescribable sort of
<i><span lang="fr_FR">malaise</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
At one o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we reached the gates of
Budua, where I was met by Baron Heydeg and
Signor Marco Medin. Heydeg was an officer
quartered with his regiment at Budua, whose
acquaintance I had made at Pola, and with whom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
I had subsequently travelled. Medin was a native
of Budua, who had left his country many years
before, had made money in California, had married
there a buxom Irish girl, a native of Ballinrobe,
and had now returned, a rich man, to end his days
among his relations in Dalmatia.
</p>

<p>
They had been waiting for me a long time, and
had walked some miles on the road to Cattaro to
meet me, but were beginning to think I was not
going to keep my word.
</p>

<p>
We were soon seated together at a comfortable
supper, and at half-past two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I was finally
allowed to retire to my bed, which Medin had
kindly procured for me in a private house—because
here, as in Cattaro, there is no hotel of any
kind.
</p>

<p>
Tired and sleepy as I was, I passed but an indifferent
night, for, notwithstanding that my room
had two large windows overlooking the sea, and that
I kept them both open, the heat was perfectly
stifling.
</p>

<p>
I was just thinking of going out the next
morning about ten, when in walked the Baron
and Signor Medin, and we at once adjourned for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
breakfast at the same place where we had supped
the previous night; I say place, as it was neither
an inn nor a <i>café</i>. How shall I describe it? The
following is the way we got at it, anyhow. In
the main street of Budua, near to the land gate,
on the left hand as you come in, you meet with
five rugged stone steps, flanked by a shaky single
iron railing. These lead up to a strong wooden
door, which at some period, of its existence may
have enjoyed the privilege of paint, but of which
no trace remains at the present moment, not even
enough to enable one to make a guess at the colour
it once enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Entering by this door, I found myself in a stuffy,
dirty hall, "<i><span lang="it_IT">a terreno</span></i>" pervaded by a multitude of
vile smells, one more awful than the other, but all
so dovetailed and commingled that it was perfectly
impossible to tell what the composition was.
Turning sharp to the left, we mounted a steep
stone staircase, at the top of which we were greeted
by the same odour that had met us on entering,
in which now the smell of assafœtida and
garlic clearly predominated. We found ourselves
in the kitchen of the establishment, over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
which reigned supreme a good-humoured, fat
German <i>Frau</i> of fifty or more, assisted by two
bright-eyed, sharp-looking Dalmatian lads, begrimed
with dirt and shining with grease and
perspiration. The <i>Frau</i> piloted us through this
kitchen, where the heat must have been 110°, if
not more, and brought us into the dining-room,
a pretty good-sized room with windows round the
three sides of it, the furniture consisting solely of
one long deal table down the middle, and a score
of rush-bottomed chairs around it. At this table
were seated a dozen or so of German officers
demolishing their "early bit."
</p>

<p>
I was here received by the <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau's</span></i> worse half,
a portly man of sixty or thereabouts. His coat
was off, but he had on instead a huge pair of silver
spectacles. He at once showed me to my seat at the
table, when I apologised, through the Baron, to
the officers for disturbing them at their breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the unpromising condition of
things, the breakfast was excellent; but mine
host in the shirt sleeves, with whom I kept up
a running conversation in Italian, was even better.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
An Italian by birth and education (for he was
very well educated), he had rambled all over the
Austrian dominions and the Turkish provinces in
Europe. He had forgotten most of his native
tongue without learning any other, and the jargon
he spoke was something marvellous. Still, he
varied this <i>pot-pourri</i> according to the nationality
of those he addressed. The foundation was
always Italian, but if he spoke to an Austrian
the German element would predominate, while if
he spoke to a Montenegrin the Slave would be
in the ascendant. He was a most amusing character,
and combined in himself the functions of
doctor, dentist and apothecary, as well as that
of keeper of a restaurant in Budua—hence the
villainous combination of the odours of a scullery,
a kitchen, and a pharmacy.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his griminess and the vile odours,
I had some very pleasant conversation with him.
I found him very well informed, and he gave
me a most interesting account of the last descent
of the Montenegrins. He had a most unconquerable
horror of my favourite mountaineers,
and believed there could be no peace nor prosperity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
in that part of the world until they should
be all exterminated.
</p>

<p>
Having finished our breakfast, Heydeg and I
strolled outside the walls to where the market is
held under some magnificent old carob trees, and
there, as at Cattaro, were numbers of Montenegrins
disposing of their produce. Here we had some
delicious fresh figs, and then lighting our cigars
we went round the old fortifications, which are
now only just sufficient for protection at night
against any sudden incursion of the wild tribes
of the interior. Then we had a good bathe in
a most delicious little cove, entirely girt round
with rocks, and with a sandy bottom that felt
like velvet under our feet. We then again lit
another cigar, and started on a tour of exploration
through this old town.
</p>

<p>
Budua, situated at the extreme end of Dalmatia,
in what used to be called Northern Albania, is
the last Austrian city on the coast of the Adriatic.
It is built on a low rocky promontory, and
possesses no interest, save in its picturesque
appearance, which it derives from its mediæval
walls and machicolated towers—useless, indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
against a civilized enemy, but still offering some
protection against possible irruptions from
Albanian freebooters. It is especially picturesque
as seen from the sea, with its rugged background
of naked mountains. Immediately about it there
is some cultivation on the narrow strip of land
which lies between the mountains and the sea;
and corn, vines, olive trees, and mulberries for the
rearing of silk-worms, are diligently grown.
</p>

<p>
Inside, it is not attractive—its streets are
extremely narrow, no more than six feet wide
in many instances; they are, however, well paved,
and would do well enough, were it not for the
utter disregard to cleanliness and drainage. Still
there are some wealthy people living there, and
many of the houses are very good and substantial.
There are several good shops, (perhaps
the word stores would best describe them), where
a brisk trade seemed to be carried on. The
Baron and I poked our way through all the
nooks and crannies of the place. We found
nothing to invite attention, but a great deal to
shock the sight, and even the sense of smell.
So we hurried on and went to pay a visit to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
my buxom Ballinrobe friend, who had not only
quite forgotten her ancestral brogue, but had
actually exchanged it for a decided American
accent, which, to my ears, was not an improvement.
She offered us neither English tea nor Irish
whiskey punch, but gave us some delicious
lemonade and maraschino; and showed by her
manner that, if the brogue was gone, the hearty
Irish welcome was there still.
</p>

<p>
From thence I went with the Baron to his own
little apartment, which opened on to an enchanting
little terrace, covered over with a grand "<i>pergola</i>"
of vines, under whose refreshing shade we smoked
away the time till we should go to dinner.
</p>

<p>
We had not been long enjoying an excellent
repast at our pharmaceutical (deuced hard name
to spell, by-the-by) restaurant when we were
informed that the steamer for Corfu was entering
the harbour, and would leave in two hours.
</p>

<p>
The time for parting had come at last, fresh
bottles were tapped, and we all drank each others'
health, and a happy journey to me amidst noisy
demonstrations and much clinking of glasses.
Dinner being at last completed, we all arose and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
walked in a body to the Mole, where, my
luggage having preceded me, I went at once on
board. There was no time for lengthy adieux,
the steamer was whistling, and almost while we
were shaking hands she cast off her moorings, and
we were off.

AFTER leaving Budua we kept close
in shore, enjoying the wild rugged
scenery of the Dalmatian coast till
we reached Antivari, where we first came into
immediate contact with the Turks on their own
Ottoman soil. The first impression, I must confess,
was certainly not a favourable one.
</p>

<p>
Should any one of my readers, with a bias in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
favour of Ottomans and Ottoman rule, ever determine
on visiting Turkey, let him not receive his
first impression of that empire by a visit to
Antivari. A few wretched hovels, a miserable
white-washed house, with a small and dirty red
flag over it; a group of miserably-dressed, vile-countenanced,
ragamuffin-looking soldiers, in
baggy blue trousers and crimson fezzes, constituted
all the features of the place. The
town of Antivari itself, I heard, was a few
miles inland, but if one may judge of the town
from its villainous port, it must be wretched in the
extreme.
</p>

<p>
The steamer remained here a couple of hours
to land goods and take in passengers, but as the
heat was excessive and the prospect of the country
most unpromising, I made no attempt to land. I
did not however lack entertainment, and while I
lounged over the bulwarks on the shady side
of the steamer, I amused myself pitching half-francs
into the water, which was of very considerable
depth and of the clearest and limpidest
blue, to half a score or so of lads and small boys
who were swimming, and diving, and treading the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
water in the most surprising manner; they seemed
just as much at home in the sea as on the land,
and fetched up the coins from the bottom as
easily as I could have picked them up from the
deck.
</p>

<p>
When tired of looking at the swimmers, I
turned to watch the new arrivals, of which we
had a considerable number, all Orientals, and
almost all deck passengers. The first which
caught my eye, coming up the side of the steamer,
was a wretched-looking, squalid creature, dressed
in rags, but most picturesque withal. He was
small, slight, and extremely dark, just short of
black, but with distinctly Caucasian features, not
a negroid by any means. He had a small
bundle over his shoulders, and in his right
hand he carried a short lance, with a very
bright steel head, ornamented with a few lines
of Damascene work in gold. His head was
covered with a somewhat conical-shaped cap,
encircled with a scanty and very ragged green
turban, while at his side he carried a moderate
sized bottle-gourd. He was a very singular
looking being, and all I could make out through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
the captain was that he thought he was a
dervish returning home from visiting some
sacred shrine in Mahomedan Europe. As
to his home, he suspected from his costume
it might be in Kurdistan, but it was very
much guess work, as the Captain spoke neither
Arabic nor Turkish.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting group consisted of three
gaily dressed Orientals, in bag trousers tight at
the knees, turban, and highly embroidered jackets.
They made their way to the quarter-deck abaft
the paddle box, and were about being summarily
ejected by the steward in consequence of being
deck passengers, when I interposed, and got him
to let them stay for a while. They perfectly
well understood that it was owing to my interference
they were allowed to remain, and so we
knocked up a sort of acquaintance, and carried
on a lame, very lame conversation by the help
of the youngest, who could speak a very few
words of Italian. I could not make out any
thing about them, whence they came, or whither
they were going, but from their features I
could easily see they were Asiatics, Arabs most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
probably, and the youngest, who was also the
lightest in colour, had three scars on each
cheek, not unlike in shape to our broad
arrow.
</p>

<p>
How I longed for a knowledge of Arabic,
how I envied Captain Burton! If he had been
there we should at once have known all about them,
and the dervish and everyone else, including a
tall, handsome Soudani slave, who kept grinning
and showing his teeth from ear to ear,
while I was carrying on my lame conversation with
the Arabs.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point, Italian and German had
enabled me to get on famously; but now that
I was getting among Asiatics, although I was
still in Europe, I felt my utter helplessness,
and the absolute necessity for a knowledge of
the language of the Koran, for those who
wish to visit the East with pleasure and
profit.
</p>

<p>
The whole deck forward was encumbered
with passengers. In one corner seated on a
pile of luggage, but well bolstered up by rolls
of Persian carpets, was a most truculent-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
Oriental, attended by an intelligent-looking young
negro, with a most astonishing Caucasian type
of countenance. He wore nothing but a white
calico sort of shirt with loose sleeves, and a
string of red beads round his neck. He had
none of the characteristics of the negro except
the colour; had I known anything of Arabic, I
could most probably have learnt something about
his origin.
</p>

<p>
In another corner of the deck a Mahomedan
merchant (as I was informed he was) had contrived
to screen off a place for himself and his
family, one of whom, about three years old, was
sprawling stark naked on a rug in the broiling
sun, while a closely veiled female, his mother I
suppose, was chasing small deer all over his person,
which was closely spotted as if with measles—but
they were only bites!
</p>

<p>
Quite at the prow of the vessel, somewhat apart,
and separated from the rest, was a military officer,
evidently of some considerable rank, if one could
judge by the orders and stars fastened to his
breast, his handsome hilted sabre, and his patent
leather boots. He was a heavy morose-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
man of about fifty, with close cropped black beard,
blue Turkish uniform, and crimson fez. I was
told he was a real pasha, and had with him a
suite of two officers and half a dozen soldiers.
He was only a deck passenger like the others;
but whether he travelled so from poverty,
from motives of economy, or from scorning to
associate with the hated and <i>envied</i> Nazarenes,
I cannot tell, though I strongly suspect
that genuine impecuniosity was the real cause
of it.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish troops I saw in this part of
Albania were the most wretched specimens I
ever witnessed, small, mean, dirty, disreputable-looking
in the extreme, and their officers matched
them to perfection. Having remarked on their
appearance, I was told by the captain of the
steamer not to form an opinion of the Ottoman army
by such samples, as they always sent their worst
regiments to Albania, and that these wretched
troops, both officers and men, were always months in
arrears of pay.
</p>

<p>
At last every one was on board, the last package
was hoisted over the side, and again we were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
steaming down southwards. The afternoon was
very enjoyable, the heat much less, and as
the number of cabin passengers was small, we
were able to have our supper on deck, which we
enjoyed immensely.
</p>

<p>
After the meal was concluded, I again went forward
among the natives, and soon made friends
with many of the dusky passengers by means of a
few signs; but our conversation was not lively—signs
and gesticulations and dumb show were the
principal means of conversation—of language we
made little or no use. Had I known ever so little
of Arabic we could have got on fairly enough—the
pantomime of these Orientals being so wonderfully
expressive. So I returned to the quarter-deck,
where I had some coffee with the captain, and then
feeling tired, I went down to my <i>camerino</i>, and
was soon asleep.
</p>

<p>
On awaking the next morning I found we
were at anchor opposite the town and fortress of
Castel Durazzo, telling of its Venetian origin by
its name. Here we remained a few hours, but the
place did not look attractive, and as I did not feel
quite "the thing," I did not go on shore, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
remained on deck looking at the motley groups as
they passed up and down. Again we had the usual
interchange of passengers and goods, and after a
few hours' delay we were just about steaming
away when the return steamer from Corfu came
alongside of us.
</p>

<p>
As chance would have it, it turned out to be
the very boat which had brought me down to
Cattaro; and no sooner did the captain spy me
out on deck than he shouted that the quarantine had
been declared at Corfu against all vessels coming from
Trieste, and that if I went on I should be detained
to perform fourteen days of quarantine in the
Lazzaretto, instead of being allowed to continue
my journey on to Constantinople. I asked him
to come over, which he did at once, and having
held a consultation with the other captain, who
entirely agreed with him that I should most certainly
be detained a fortnight at Corfu, and be
compelled to perform my quarantine in the
Lazzaretto, I determined on returning to Trieste.
Fourteen days in a Lazzaretto anywhere would be
a severe ordeal, but fourteen days of such an
imprisonment during the dog-days at Corfu could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
not possibly have been faced; it would not only have
been a severe trial of patience in every shape and
form, but might have been conducive to serious
illness.
</p>

<p>
There was no time to be lost, so my luggage
was at once put into the captain's boat, and in a
few minutes I again found myself on board the
old steamer, where Giovanni, the steward, greeted
me as if I had been an old friend.

<p>
At sunset we steamed away northward from
Castel Durazzo. The captain was delighted to
see me again, and Giovanni was most affable,
doing his utmost to promote my happiness.
But like Rachel of old I would not be comforted,
all my plans were thoroughly upset; I could not
bring myself to make fresh arrangements. I was
turning my back on my beloved South and I was
retracing my steps—both things I utterly detested.
But <i><span lang="it_IT">non ci era rimedio</span></i>, the quarantine and the
Lazzaretto I could not face, so there was
nothing else to do but resign oneself to the
fates.
</p>

<p>
The next morning we came abreast of Budua,
but I did not land as I did not feel well. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
screwed up my courage, however, and attempted
a little sketch of its castle and harbour, with
its blue sea and its background of rocky
mountains. After a little, and just as we were
leaving the place, I felt worse, so I took some
medicine and went to lie down. In two hours
more I was in high fever, with a racking pain
in my head and back, and I felt my mind almost
wandering. We reached the Bocche that evening,
but the beauties of the Fjord were lost to me—I
lay in my cabin prostrated. Giovanni came
instantly to see me, trying to comfort me by
telling me I had only caught "<i><span lang="it_IT">la febbre</span></i>," and
that I should send for the doctor at Cattaro to
get myself bled, and take quinine, when I should
be all right. I think that the idea of Giovanni's
bringing a doctor and having me bled, <i><span lang="la">nolens
volens</span></i>, roused me up. I made myself some tea,
and just as we reached Cattaro I felt much
better—the fever had abated, and now, said I,
is the time to take the quinine.
</p>

<p>
I had brought lots of it with me, so I measured
out as much as I could pile upon a shilling, and
bolted it. It certainly cut short the disease, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
the fever did not set in again; but I was not
well for many days after, and even when I
arrived at Trieste I felt quite weak and out
of sorts.
</p>

<p>
The next morning early we left Cattaro, and
in the afternoon got to Gravosa. I felt somewhat
better, and hearing that Consul Paton, who was
then alive, and his family were in a villa just opposite
to where the steamer was moored, I took a boat and
spent two delightful hours with them, till the
steam-whistle told me how quickly the time
had flown. I reluctantly made my adieux, and
soon was steaming out of the harbour.
</p>

<p>
It wanted scarcely an hour of sunset: the sun
was low in the horizon—all the lights and
shades were the more intensely marked, while
the constantly changing tints, from brightest rose
and golden yellow to the deepest violets and
blues, created such a fairy scene that I would not
venture to describe it.
</p>

<p>
I was in the fullest enjoyment of that sunset,
gazing on where the sun was just dipping into
the sea, sending a flood of golden light along the
surface from himself to us, when the captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
tapped me on the shoulder, saying, "<i><span lang="it_IT">Vada giù</span></i>, you
had <i><span lang="it_IT">la febbre</span></i> last night; don't expose yourself
to the air <i><span lang="it_IT">al tramonto</span></i>;" so I took his advice,
and went down below, notwithstanding the heat,
and so ended the 23rd day of July!
</p>

<p>
The following day saw us at Lesina and at
Curzola, and again at Lissa. The day after
brought us abreast of Spalato, where again I
enjoyed a couple of hours' ramble among those
glorious ruins. Then we cruised through the
countless islands near the mouth of the Quarnero,
and finally reached Trieste, where, after having
enjoyed two pleasant days with Captain Burton
and his charming and talented lady, I turned my
steps towards home.
</p>

<p>
Here I take my leave of the reader. If he shall
be disappointed with my style and my many shortcomings
I shall not be surprised; but I shall be
disappointed indeed if, following a somewhat
similar track to the one I have been tracing,
only penetrating, if possible, more into Servia
proper, and going across it from the Danube to
the Adriatic, he shall not feel himself amply repaid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
by having taken my advice in visiting
those countries which I have endeavoured to
describe.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_1'>[1]</a></span> Since writing the above I have obtained the following authentic
description of this ship. The "Lissa" ironclad was built at Trieste.
She is a full-rigged casemated ironclad of 5950 tons, 320 feet long, 60
feet beam, and drawing 28 feet of water. Armoured with 6-inch Austrian
plates, the armament consisting of ten 9-inch breech-loading
Krupp guns in her maindeck casemate, and two 9-inch breech-loading
Krupp guns on turn-tables in semi-circular overhanging casemates on
the open deck, the guns being protected from above by a sort of
central hurricane deck. The "Lissa" steams at the rate of twelve
knots, and carries coals for 420 hours; among other improvements
she has a powerful electric light placed on the bridge, and gimballed,
so as to allow it to be thrown in any direction.

men into the lowlands, attempted the capture of Sebenico and its
fort; but it was so well defended by the 6000 Venetians and German
mercenaries of the garrison, that after twenty-six days' cannonade the
Pasha was obliged to retire.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_5'>[5]</a></span> The brave King Richard, having recruited himself at Ragusa, is
said, by some, to have gone to Aquileia by sea, by others to have
continued his journey by land; anyhow, it is pretty certain, that
having stopped to take some refreshment at a way-side inn in the
mountains of Dalmatia, or Styria, he incautiously handed a large
gold piece to the landlady to change, and her suspicions being roused
by this circumstance, she informed the authorities; and the end was
that the King was seized by the treacherous Leopold of Austria, and
imprisoned, as everyone knows. There is a tradition, however, which
is not so well known, that shortly after his treacherous conduct
to his brother-in-arms, Leopold of Austria, when out hunting, met
with a severe injury to his right leg—surgery was not then what
it is now—the limb mortified, and it was agreed on all hands
that nothing could save the Prince's life but amputation. But who
was to do it? No one would venture—when Leopold himself proposed
that a sharp hatchet should be laid across his limb, and that,
at his word of command, it should be struck with a ponderous mallet,
when it was expected that the limb would be severed. The operation
succeeded so far as the cutting went, but the bystanders were unable
to staunch the blood, and the Prince bled to death—a fitting retribution
for his treachery.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_6'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_6'>[6]</a></span> The story, as well as I remember it, was as follows:—A probably
well-meaning but decidedly weak-minded Protestant, bent on missionary
work, arrived one day at Tangier. He had never been in
the East, and did not know a word of Arabic. He was determined,
however, to improve the opportunity by letting in a ray of Gospel
truth into the minds of the benighted Mussulmans. That he did not
know a word of their native language was no obstacle to this energetic
missionary, he would employ an interpreter. Having found one in
the person of a 'Gibraltar Jew,' he explained to him what he wanted;
the bargain was soon struck, and the Jew undertook, for a consideration,
to interpret for him on the next market day. He, however,
advised the missionary to have a certain quantity of tobacco and coffee
ready to treat the assembled hearers, as it was always customary to
do so in that country whenever an important meeting was held—to
which the missionary at once consented. The fact of the danger he
would be running into himself, dragging his interpreter after him,
from telling the most bigoted perhaps of all Mussulmans, that their
religion was false, and their Prophet an emissary of the Evil One,
never once entered into his head; but, fortunately for them both, the
Jew had more brain than his employer. Market-day came, and the
Jew had bespoke, in a couple of cafés, a large supply of coffee. The
town and country people having been informed that an "Effendi
Engleez" would make a great speech to them, they collected in large
numbers in the market-place, where they squatted down round a
hogshead, on which the missionary was mounted. He at once began
in the usual terms—his religion was the only true one, and all those
who differed from him went straight down head foremost into Gehenna,
which the wise Jew translated thus: "The Effendi has come all the
way from England to get cured; he is mad, but quite harmless, and
if you only have patience, you will get plenty of coffee." And so the
missionary went on ringing the changes on his subject, whilst the
wiser Jew rang the changes on his; which, however, always ended in
the stereotyped, "and you'll get plenty of coffee." The report, probably
made to head-quarters by that enterprising missionary, would
be interesting to read, especially by the light thrown upon it by the
interpreter; and how many more missionary efforts might prove
equally distressing could we but have together with the sermon the
running commentary of a non-interested looker-on.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_7'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_7'>[7]</a></span> I had taken exact measurements, but some of my notes were
unfortunately lost—the above measurements are, therefore, only
approximative.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_8'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_8'>[8]</a></span> I was informed at Cettigne that trout were caught in the Moratcha
of fifty or sixty pounds weight; not salmon, for the Moratcha
does not go to the sea, and if it did go, there are no salmon in the
Adriatic. Thinking it must be a joke, I asked several persons of
standing, who all assured me that it was perfectly true. I regret that
being unprovided with tackle, in addition to being short of time, I
was unable to test the accuracy of these assertions, mainly in reference
to my readers, because as to myself I have no reason whatever to doubt
the truth, accuracy, and bona-fides of my informants; I fully accept
what I heard from them, especially from my previous knowledge of
the amazing number and size of the trout in the Servian rivers.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
